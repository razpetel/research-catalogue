| 2026-02-08 | Claude Opus 4.6 & Fast Mode | Anthropic's new flagship model (Feb 5, 2026) with 1M context, 128K output, adaptive thinking, agent teams, and 500 zero-day vulnerability discoveries. Fast mode (Feb 7) delivers 2.5x speed at 6x cost ($30/$150 MTok). Genuine leap for agentic coding (ARC AGI 2: +31pp, Terminal-Bench SOTA) but writing quality regressed and token consumption is 1.5-2x higher than 4.5. GPT-5.3 Codex launched 27 minutes later. Community polarized: "mind-blowing" for coding vs "IQ dropped 20 points" for prose. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-08-claude-opus-46-fast-mode.md) |
| 2026-02-08 | awesome-slash | Comprehensive plugin system (11 plugins, 40 agents, 26 skills) by AWS engineer Avi Fenesh automating the full dev workflow beyond code generation for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex CLI. 355 stars in 24 days with unique features (/deslop, /agnix) and deterministic-first approach. However: single maintainer (495/496 commits), zero community visibility (no Reddit/Twitter mentions, not in any curated list), aggressive versioning (v1.0->v4.1 in 24 days), and all claims unverified. Promising engineering but watch and evaluate. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-08-awesome-slash.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Babysitter (a5c-ai) | Event-sourced orchestration framework for Claude Code with JavaScript-defined processes, quality convergence loops, breakpoints web UI for human approval, and claimed 2,000+ pre-built process definitions. 289 stars in 45 days, 86 npm versions (v0.0.168), MIT licensed. Architecture is genuinely novel (deterministic replay, CQRS, Saga patterns) but zero community visibility (no Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn mentions), single maintainer, and the massive process library is likely AI-generated. Interesting architecture to watch; wait for community validation before adoption. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-babysitter-a5c-ai.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | ivrit-ai | Israeli non-profit producing the world's largest open Hebrew speech dataset (22,000+ hours) and state-of-the-art Hebrew ASR models (whisper-large-v3, turbo) with 29% WER improvement over baseline Whisper, published at Interspeech 2025. Free for commercial use, 21 HuggingFace models, 24 datasets, 10 GitHub repos. The only significant open-source Hebrew ASR effort -- essential for any Hebrew speech application. Sustainability risk from volunteer model but remarkable output-to-cost ratio. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-ivrit-ai.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | WhisperFlow | Heavily overloaded name spanning 6+ entities. The dominant one is Wispr Flow (wisprflow.ai), an $81M-funded AI voice dictation SaaS (Mac/Windows/iOS/Android) with best-in-class AI post-processing, 270 Fortune 500 teams, and 70% 1-year retention — but polarizing sentiment over Electron bloat, cloud-only privacy concerns, and $15/mo pricing. Also notable: dimastatz/whisper-flow (621-star MIT-licensed Python library for real-time Whisper streaming at 275ms latency) and an ACM MobiSys 2025 paper achieving 1.6-4.7x latency reduction on ARM devices. 15+ open-source alternatives emerging driven by subscription fatigue. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-whisperflow.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | superwhisper | Privacy-first AI voice dictation app by bootstrapped Canadian startup SuperUltra, Inc. (Neil Chudleigh). Uses local Whisper models + cloud LLMs (GPT-5, Claude, Llama 4). Andrej Karpathy coined "vibe coding" while using it, cementing its developer mindshare. $249 lifetime license is unique among premium tools. Power users love the deep customization (modes, context awareness via accessibility APIs); casual users find it overpriced vs VoiceInk ($39 OSS) and BetterDictation ($24). Biggest risk: unresponsive developer support cited in 4+ independent threads. | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-superwhisper.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | SkillForge | Meta-skill for Claude Code by Jack Atlasov (tripleyak) that generates high-quality skills through a 4-phase pipeline with 11 thinking lenses and multi-agent synthesis requiring unanimous Opus 4.5 agent approval. 510 GitHub stars, MIT licensed, but built in a 2-day burst (Dec 30-31, 2025) with no commits since and an unmerged community PR for 41 days. Heavily overloaded brand name (10+ unrelated entities). Worth studying the methodology; don't depend on the maintainer. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-skillforge.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | AI Presentation-Creating Tools (Comparison) | Comparative analysis of 5 presentation tools across the full spectrum: Gamma (30M users, best visual quality, $0-20/mo but PPT export is Achilles' heel), Anthropic PPTX Skill (71.7K stars, native PPTX output, 3 deployment surfaces including PowerPoint add-in, best for enterprise), Marp (17.8K stars, 8-year Markdown ecosystem, developer gold standard), Manus (Meta-acquired $2B agent with research-integrated slides but expensive credits and formatting issues), and frontend-slides (904 stars in 3 weeks, novel zero-dependency HTML approach but unproven). Central industry tension: speed/AI quality vs. design polish/export fidelity. PPTX Skill and frontend-slides sidestep the "export problem" by generating native output formats. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-presentation-creating-tools.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Entire.io | AI-native developer platform by former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke with record $60M seed at $300M valuation. First product Checkpoints (entireio/cli, 2.7K stars, Go, MIT) hooks into Git to capture AI agent session transcripts, prompts, token usage, and attribution on an orphan branch. Supports Claude Code and Gemini CLI with Copilot coming. Solves real "review bottleneck" for AI-generated code but only 9 days old with active bugs and no user reviews yet. Planned semantic layer and AI-native interface are vaporware. Worth installing today; watch the platform thesis carefully. | Positive (Early) | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-entire-io.md) |
