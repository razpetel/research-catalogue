Visily rated best pure wireframe tool ($14/mo, 5/5 expert score), Google Stitch best free option, v0 best for React developers. Growing debate: "Do you still need wireframes?" as AI prototyping tools make traditional wireframing potentially obsolete. Optimal 2026 workflow: Stitch (ideate) → Visily/Figma Make (wireframe) → Claude Code (implement). | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-06-ai-wireframe-tools.md) |
| 2026-02-09 | Claude Code Agent Teams | First-party multi-agent feature enabling parallel Claude Code instances with peer-to-peer messaging and shared task lists. 5 releases in 3 days fixed core tmux bug; ~97 total issues (65 open). Benchmarked: Terminal-Bench 65.4% (vs Codex 77.3%), 3-team costs ~800k tokens (4x solo). Goldman Sachs partnership, GitHub Agent HQ launch, 12+ ecosystem repos in 3 days. Community consensus: team of 3 beats 6; read-intensive tasks are the sweet spot. UX praised as "shockingly good" but code quality still needs rigorous review. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-09-claude-code-agent-teams.md) |
| 2026-02-06 | Claude's C Compiler (CCC) | 100,000-line Rust-based C compiler built autonomously by 16 parallel Claude Opus 4.6 agents over 2 weeks at $20K cost. Compiles Linux 6.9, PostgreSQL, FFmpeg, Doom across x86/ARM/RISC-V. 727 GitHub stars in hours, but can't compile hello world out-of-box (issue #1) and code quality called "bloated." Lobsters/Reddit skeptical of selection bias and missing transparency. Valuable as a research demonstration of multi-agent coordination and test-driven autonomy methodology; not a production compiler. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-06-claudes-c-compiler.md) |
| 2026-02-06 | Vercel Agent Skills Architecture | Two-part case study: Vercel's controlled evaluation found AGENTS.md (passive context) achieves 100% pass rate vs Skills' 53% for Next.js 16 APIs — skills weren't invoked 56% of the time. The architectural response: AI SDK Agent Skills guide's three-phase progressive disclosure (Discovery → Activation → Execution) keeps skill descriptions always in context while loading full content lazily, directly addressing the invocation failure. Part of AI SDK (21.5K stars). Vendor-neutral SKILL.md format converging with Claude Code Skills and obra/superpowers. Ecosystem forming: Bluebag.ai commercial bridge, agent-skills.md community registry. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-06-vercel-agent-skills-architecture.md) |

Fast mode (Feb 7) delivers 2.5x speed at 6x cost ($30/$150 MTok). Genuine leap for agentic coding (ARC AGI 2: +31pp, Terminal-Bench SOTA) but writing quality regressed and token consumption is 1.5-2x higher than 4.5. GPT-5.3 Codex launched 27 minutes later. Community polarized: "mind-blowing" for coding vs "IQ dropped 20 points" for prose. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-08-claude-opus-46-fast-mode.md) |
| 2026-02-08 | awesome-slash | Comprehensive plugin system (11 plugins, 40 agents, 26 skills) by AWS engineer Avi Fenesh automating the full dev workflow beyond code generation for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex CLI. 355 stars in 24 days with unique features (/deslop, /agnix) and deterministic-first approach. However: single maintainer (495/496 commits), zero community visibility (no Reddit/Twitter mentions, not in any curated list), aggressive versioning (v1.0->v4.1 in 24 days), and all claims unverified. Promising engineering but watch and evaluate. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-08-awesome-slash.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Babysitter (a5c-ai) | Event-sourced orchestration framework for Claude Code with JavaScript-defined processes, quality convergence loops, breakpoints web UI for human approval, and claimed 2,000+ pre-built process definitions. 289 stars in 45 days, 86 npm versions (v0.0.168), MIT licensed. Architecture is genuinely novel (deterministic replay, CQRS, Saga patterns) but zero community visibility (no Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn mentions), single maintainer, and the massive process library is likely AI-generated. Interesting architecture to watch; wait for community validation before adoption. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-babysitter-a5c-ai.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | ivrit-ai | Israeli non-profit producing the world's largest open Hebrew speech dataset (22,000+ hours) and state-of-the-art Hebrew ASR models (whisper-large-v3, turbo) with 29% WER improvement over baseline Whisper, published at Interspeech 2025. Free for commercial use, 21 HuggingFace models, 24 datasets, 10 GitHub repos. The only significant open-source Hebrew ASR effort -- essential for any Hebrew speech application. Sustainability risk from volunteer model but remarkable output-to-cost ratio. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-ivrit-ai.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Voice Dictation Tools Comparison (macOS) | Unified comparison of VoiceInk, Superwhisper, and Wispr Flow across pricing, privacy model, context awareness, and platform support, plus a consolidated competitive landscape of 15+ tools. VoiceInk ($40 one-time, GPL-3.0) is the community value pick; Superwhisper ($249 lifetime) leads on macOS integration and the Karpathy "vibe coding" endorsement but has unresponsive support; Wispr Flow ($81M funded, $15/mo) wins on AI post-processing quality and cross-platform reach (Mac/Win/iOS/Android) but is cloud-only. Appendix covers dimastatz/whisper-flow (621-star MIT Python library for real-time Whisper) and the ACM MobiSys 2025 paper on ARM latency reduction. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-voice-dictation-comparison.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | SkillForge | Meta-skill for Claude Code by Jack Atlasov (tripleyak) that generates high-quality skills through a 4-phase pipeline with 11 thinking lenses and multi-agent synthesis requiring unanimous Opus 4.5 agent approval. 510 GitHub stars, MIT licensed, but built in a 2-day burst (Dec 30-31, 2025) with no commits since and an unmerged community PR for 41 days. Heavily overloaded brand name (10+ unrelated entities). Worth studying the methodology; don't depend on the maintainer. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-skillforge.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | AI Presentation-Creating Tools (Comparison) | Comparative analysis of 5 presentation tools across the full spectrum: Gamma (30M users, best visual quality, $0-20/mo but PPT export is Achilles' heel), Anthropic PPTX Skill (71.7K stars, native PPTX output, 3 deployment surfaces including PowerPoint add-in, best for enterprise), Marp (17.8K stars, 8-year Markdown ecosystem, developer gold standard), Manus (Meta-acquired $2B agent with research-integrated slides but expensive credits and formatting issues), and frontend-slides (904 stars in 3 weeks, novel zero-dependency HTML approach but unproven). Central industry tension: speed/AI quality vs. design polish/export fidelity. PPTX Skill and frontend-slides sidestep the "export problem" by generating native output formats. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-presentation-creating-tools.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Entire.io | AI-native developer platform by former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke with record $60M seed at $300M valuation. First product Checkpoints (entireio/cli, 2.7K stars, Go, MIT) hooks into Git to capture AI agent session transcripts, prompts, token usage, and attribution on an orphan branch. Supports Claude Code and Gemini CLI with Copilot coming. Solves real "review bottleneck" for AI-generated code but only 9 days old with active bugs and no user reviews yet. Planned semantic layer and AI-native interface are vaporware. Worth installing today; watch the platform thesis carefully. | Positive (Early) | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-entire-io.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | OSXSkills (App Store Code Review) | Three Claude Code skills by Solomon Kashani (Qneura.ai) for shipping macOS apps: 10-category pre-submission code review (64KB SKILL.md), infrastructure compliance auditing, and native AI model selection. Uniquely covers DMG creation with Mach-O binary patching, bundled Python backend patterns, three-surface license enforcement, mandatory MCP integration, and release automation. Only 2 stars (8 days old) with zero community visibility (no Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn mentions), but occupies a genuinely uncontested niche -- no other skill addresses App Store readiness review. Heavily tailored to Flutter + Python + macOS stack. Worth studying the DMG/release patterns; watch for community adoption before depending on it. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-osxskills-app-store-code-review.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Claude-Mem (thedotmack) | Most popular Claude Code plugin (29.2K stars) providing persistent memory via lifecycle hooks, SQLite + Chroma vector DB, and progressive disclosure MCP search tools (~10x token savings). Doubled stars from 12.9K to 29.2K in 17 days after GitHub Trending run. However: $CMEM Solana token prominently promoted in README, critical bugs (218 zombie processes, 51K+ duplicate observations), AGPL-3.0 license, and official auto-memory features closing the gap. Genuinely useful for cross-session memory today; evaluate carefully given token promotion and stability concerns. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-claude-mem.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | mgrep (mixedbread-ai) | CLI-native semantic grep by Mixedbread (Munich AI startup) that replaces brute-force pattern matching with natural language search across code, text, PDFs, and images. 3,285 stars, backed by proven embedding models (mxbai-embed-large-v1). Benchmarks show 2x token reduction and 76% quality win rate vs grep in Claude Code workflows at ~$20/month. One-command agent integration (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex). However, mandatory cloud sync of your codebase to Mixedbread servers is a dealbreaker for security-sensitive projects, and Windows is completely broken. Growing local alternatives (GrepAI, ygrep) targeting this gap. Worth adopting for non-sensitive projects; evaluate GrepAI for local-only needs. | Positive (with caveats) | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-mgrep.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | LEAP Stacks v2 | Open-source one-click CloudFormation platform by AWS Principal Startup Advocate Basil Fateen deploying 12 production-ready AI stacks (chatbots, RAG, agents, voice AI, n8n) into your own AWS account in 7 minutes. 57 GitHub stars, featured on AWS Serverless Office Hours. Killer feature: 2-hour auto-cleanup preventing bill shock. However, zero community adoption outside AWS channels (no Reddit/Twitter/news), single contributor, non-standard git workflow. Good for AWS workshops and startup prototyping; may be overtaken by AWS's improving native tooling (AgentCore, Kiro). | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-leapstacks.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Antigravity + Claude Opus 4.6 Workflow | Joe Njenga's Medium article (Feb 10, 2026) documenting how combining Claude Opus 4.6 with Google Antigravity IDE creates a powerful agentic workflow -- Opus's superior planning plus Antigravity's multi-agent orchestration and browser automation. LogRocket ranks Antigravity #2 among AI dev tools. However, the economics are punishing: one task cost $48.50 in compute, Opus 4.6 can exhaust daily free quota just planning. Community converged on hybrid approach (plan with Gemini Flash, execute with Opus). Security concerns (agent-deleted drives), quota crisis, and production gaps (no SOC 2, deployment pipeline). Powerful for prototyping; skip for production. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-antigravity-opus-46-workflow.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Alex Christou - 30 Apps in 30 Days | Product-growth-minded vibe coder (ex-VEED.IO Growth PM, $40M ARR) who shipped 30+ micro-apps in 30 days using Claude Code, documenting every day on YouTube. Pieter Levels reposted Day 17; now co-instructs Starter Story's 4x4 Bootcamp ($495, 3,000+ builders). Post-challenge, built automated Remotion + Claude Code pipeline for video generation, YouTube auto-publishing, and blog integration. Authentic build-in-public with real failures (Day 8-9 struggles) differentiates from typical AI hype. Worth following for practical vibe coding insights with a product lens. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-alex-christou-30-apps.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Genspark | AI workspace and super-agent platform by ex-Baidu executives (Eric Jing, Kay Zhu) that hit $100M ARR in 9 months and a $1.25B unicorn valuation ($460M total raised). "Mixture of Agents" architecture routes tasks across 9 LLMs with 80+ tools -- AI search, phone calls, slides, sheets, code, and a Chromium-based agentic browser. Super Bowl LX ad with Matthew Broderick drove massive awareness but mixed reception. Claims 87.8% GAIA score (disputed). Strong for breadth of capabilities and free tier; accuracy and rigidity concerns remain. Competes with Perplexity (search), Manus (deep agents), and ChatGPT (conversation). | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-genspark.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Portless (Vercel Labs) | Open-source CLI tool by Vercel Labs replacing localhost port numbers with stable, named .localhost URLs (e.g., myapp.localhost:1355). 1,228 GitHub stars in 4 days, 7 npm versions (v0.4.0), TypeScript, Apache-2.0, HTTP/2 + HTTPS support. Agent-first design with SKILL.md and AGENTS.md -- solves AI agents guessing wrong ports in monorepos. Spiritual successor to typicode/hotel (unmaintained). Single contributor, macOS/Linux only, HTTPS has open bugs. Try now for local dev/AI workflows; wait for v1.0 for team adoption. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-portless.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Excalidraw MCP | Official MCP App server from the Excalidraw organization (117K stars main repo) built by Anton Pidkuiko (Anthropic engineer). Streams hand-drawn diagrams directly into AI chat with interactive fullscreen editing, checkpoint/restore, and screenshot feedback to the model. 2,544 stars in 15 days, very active (30 commits, 4+ contributors). The flagship showcase of MCP Apps -- cited by Chrome Web MCP W3C proposal, VS Code team, and InfoWorld. Works best in Claude; Gemini/ChatGPT support nascent. AI-generated diagrams still need human refinement but the "draft then edit" workflow is seamless. Highly recommended for Claude users. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-excalidraw-mcp.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw) | First-party, open-source framework by GitHub Next, Microsoft Research, and Azure Core Upstream enabling natural language Markdown workflows compiled to GitHub Actions with AI coding agents (Copilot, Claude, Codex). 3,210 stars, 30 releases in 7 days since Feb 13 technical preview. Led by Don Syme (F# creator) and Peli de Halleux. 30+ pre-built workflows (triage, docs, CI diagnosis, testing, reporting) with defense-in-depth security (read-only by default, sandboxed execution, network isolation). Early adopters: Home Assistant, CNCF, Carvana. Hacker News skeptical about agent reliability and token costs. The only platform-native AI-in-CI/CD solution -- promising for repo maintenance toil but explicitly not a CI/CD replacement; use with caution as technical preview. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-github-agentic-workflows.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Moltbook Supabase Security Lessons | LinkedIn analysis by Roy Shasha (VP Tech Ops at Yext, ex-Goldman Sachs InfoSec) identifying two Supabase vulnerabilities behind the Moltbook breach: the well-known disabled RLS, plus a subtler SECURITY DEFINER function privilege escalation where PostgreSQL grants EXECUTE to PUBLIC by default, bypassing RLS even when enabled. Provides actionable SQL fixes and a 5-minute AI-assisted audit prompt. Moltbook itself "effectively dead" by Feb 5 per MIT Technology Review. Essential reading for Supabase developers; complements the original OpenClaw & Moltbook report (2026-02-02). | Negative (Instructive) | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-moltbook-supabase-security.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Logan (whatsapp-public-logan) | Self-hosted WhatsApp AI bot by Yuval Avidani (2x GitHub Star, cybersecurity architect) built with TypeScript/Baileys, featuring AI responses (Groq/LLaMA), daily summaries (Claude), voice transcription (Whisper), spam detection, and a unique 4-layer Shabbat auto-lock system (Hebcal API) for Hebrew-speaking communities. 47 stars and 19 forks in 6 days, MIT licensed, but single-commit sanitized dump with zero community visibility outside GitHub. Uses unofficial Baileys API (WhatsApp ban risk). Best for Hebrew-speaking community admins needing Shabbat-aware group management; not for business-critical use. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-whatsapp-public-logan.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Cognee | Open-source knowledge engine (12.4K stars, Apache 2.0) by Berlin startup topoteretes that builds persistent AI memory via knowledge graphs + vector search using a Python ECL (Extract, Cognify, Load) pipeline. Announced $7.5M funding (Pebblebed, 42CAP) today with 70+ companies implementing. Self-published benchmarks show 0.93 human-like correctness on HotPotQA, claims to outperform Mem0/LightRAG/Graphiti. The serious choice for teams needing graph-based multi-hop reasoning with ontology support (RDF + OWL); evaluate Mem0 for simpler use cases. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-cognee.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Bug Bugger (Ariel Beck) | Private serverless Slack bot by Ariel Beck (Software Architect at Oasis Security) using Claude API via Bedrock to autonomously fix bugs with a three-phase human-anchored self-learning mechanism: plan corrections (interactive Slack buttons), test failure learning (0-3 auto-extracted points per CI failure to `.claude/rules/learnings.md`), and Q&A corrections ("you were wrong" button with S3 storage and PR promotion). Timely contrast: SkillsBench study (Feb 19, 40 researchers) found self-generated skills hurt agents (-1.3pp) while human-curated skills help (+16.2%), but Bug Bugger's human-anchored design may sidestep this by recording human corrections rather than autonomous conclusions. Instructive architecture for the self-learning agent pattern; zero public visibility remains the key limitation. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-bug-bugger.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Claude Code Memory System (Official Docs) | Authoritative documentation for Claude Code's six-tier memory hierarchy: managed policy, project memory (CLAUDE.md), modular rules (.claude/rules/ with path-scoped YAML frontmatter), user memory, project local (CLAUDE.local.md), and auto memory (MEMORY.md with 200-line auto-load limit + topic files). New features: @import syntax for CLAUDE.md (recursive up to 5 hops), organization-level IT deployment, and env var control (CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=0). Community mixed-to-positive: auto memory praised as "so good" but criticized for no concurrency controls (race condition with agent teams), no semantic search, and ~O(200) rule adherence budget. 10+ GitHub repos filling gaps. Essential reference for all Claude Code users; complements prior Context Engineering report. | Positive (Authoritative) | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-claude-code-memory.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Claude Code to Figma (Code to Canvas) | Official Figma-Anthropic integration ("Code to Canvas") that converts live browser UIs built with Claude Code into fully editable Figma design frames via Remote MCP. Announced Feb 17, 2026 alongside Figma's $1B+ annual revenue earnings and Claude Sonnet 4.6. Dylan Field: "start anywhere and go anywhere." Setup: `claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`. Limitations: Claude Code exclusive, business logic lost in roundtrips, enterprise-gated Code Connect. Massive news coverage (CNBC, Fortune). Reddit mixed on differentiation from Figma Make. Strategically significant; practically useful for design-developer teams already on Claude Code. | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-claude-code-to-figma.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | claude-relay (chadbyte) | Zero-install, zero-cloud browser UI for Claude Code with push notifications, driven by Claude Agent SDK via WebSocket relay. `npx claude-relay` gives you a local web server with mobile access, session handoff, file browser, built-in terminal, and multi-project daemon on one port. 81 stars and 2,000+ npm downloads in 10 days, 23 npm versions (v2.2.3), MIT licensed. Sound architecture (daemon + Unix socket IPC + append-only JSONL) but single maintainer and far behind established alternatives (Happy Coder 12.6K, Claudia 19.9K). Worth trying for local/Tailscale use; evaluate Happy Coder for mobile-first or Claudia for full desktop toolkit. | Positive (Early) | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-claude-relay.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Agentic RAG with Knowledge Graphs (Idan Benaun) | LinkedIn post by Idan Benaun (Sr. Director AI/ML at OpenWeb) showing ~40% "novel information" improvement by injecting compact per-customer Knowledge Graphs (300-600 tokens) into Agentic RAG context. Lands at inflection point: Graphwise GraphRAG launch, Neo4j Aura Agent GA, industry converging on "standard RAG is dead" split into CAG (static) and Agentic RAG (dynamic reasoning). ~10x cost increase over standard RAG remains the key challenge. Essential reading for teams evaluating graph-enhanced retrieval. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-agentic-rag-knowledge-graphs.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | NotebookLM MCP CLI (jacob-bd) | Unified Python package providing CLI (`nlm`) and MCP server for programmatic access to Google's NotebookLM via reverse-engineered internal APIs. 1,415 stars, 307 forks, ~19.4K PyPI downloads/month. 29 MCP tools covering full NotebookLM surface: notebooks, sources, AI chat, studio content (podcasts, videos, slides, mind maps, quizzes), research, sharing. Auto-setup for 7+ AI tools. Transparently "vibe coded" by non-developer but matured to 372 unit tests and clean 3-layer architecture. Cookie-based auth means periodic breakage. Dominant open-source NotebookLM automation tool. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-notebooklm-mcp-cli.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | CandleKeep (Agentic Search vs RAG) | Knowledge library product by Sahar Carmel (Mixtiles) that gives AI agents structured book access via browsing tools (TOC, page ranges, cross-references) instead of RAG. Blog post (Feb 17) clearly articulates why agentic search beats RAG for complex knowledge work, backed by Anthropic's Boris Cherny confirming Claude Code abandoned vector DB for agentic search. Product itself (getcandlekeep.com, freemium $0-10/mo) has zero community visibility -- no GitHub repo, no Reddit/Twitter mentions, no reviews. Read the blog for the argument; bookmark the product for later evaluation. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-candlekeep-agentic-search-vs-rag.md) |
| 2026-02-19 | Stitch Skills (google-labs-code) | Google's official Agent Skills library for Stitch, providing 6 skills (design-md, enhance-prompt, react-components, stitch-loop, remotion, shadcn-ui) that automate the design-to-code pipeline via AI coding agents. 1,797 stars in 5 weeks, Apache-2.0. First major Google adoption of Vercel's open Agent Skills standard (`npx skills add`), compatible with 37+ agents. The stitch-loop "baton-passing" pattern for autonomous iterative site building is architecturally novel. Part of Google's converging AI ecosystem (Stitch + Antigravity + Jules). Well-structured but early-stage (21 commits); coverage skews promotional. Recommended for Stitch users; also worth studying the skill architecture patterns. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-19-stitch-skills.md) |
| 2026-02-22 | Polar.sh | Open-source Merchant of Record billing platform (9.5K stars, Apache-2.0) by Birk Jernstrom (ex-Shopify/Tictail) that lets developers monetize software with 6 lines of code. $10M Accel-led seed with angels from Vercel, Shopify, Supabase, Raycast, and more; Mitchell Hashimoto as advisor. Cheapest MoR at 4%+40c (vs Lemon Squeezy 5%+50c). Tailwind CSS uses it. Best-in-class DX per Reddit but recurring payout review complaints and USD-only limitation. Strongest choice for indie devs selling digital products; evaluate Paddle for enterprise scale. | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-22-polar-sh.md) |
| 2026-02-22 | Rork | AI-powered mobile app builder ($2.8M a16z seed) by Daniel Dhawan & Levan Kvirkvelia that converts text to React Native/Expo apps. $0→$1M ARR in 3 months, 743K monthly visits, 1,168+ GitHub repos generated. Just launched Rork Max (native Swift via Claude Opus 4.6) for all Apple platforms. Best-in-class mobile UI generation but backend is weak, App Store publishing frequently broken, credit system called "predatory," and significant Reddit astroturfing backlash. Good for rapid mobile prototyping; expect to fix output in Claude Code/Cursor before production. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-22-rork.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | json-render (Vercel Labs) | Vercel's Generative UI framework (11.1K stars, Apache-2.0) by Chris Tate that converts AI-generated JSON into guardrailed React interfaces across web, mobile, PDF, and video from a single spec. 113K monthly npm downloads in 5 weeks with 36 pre-built shadcn/ui components and JSONL streaming. VentureBeat distinguishes it from v0: "generative software" (code) vs "generative UI" (runtime specs). Competes with Google A2UI (protocol), CopilotKit (agent layer), Tambo (SDK). Most mature library-level Generative UI implementation; recommended for React developers building AI-powered dashboards and personalized interfaces. Pre-1.0 with state management still maturing. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-json-render.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Claude Code Security | Anthropic's AI-powered vulnerability scanner (announced Feb 20, 2026) that reasons about code semantically rather than pattern-matching. Two surfaces: open-source GitHub Action (3,159 stars, MIT) and enterprise product in limited research preview. Opus 4.6 found 500+ zero-day vulns in production OSS code via 15-person Frontier Red Team. Wiped $15B+ from cybersecurity stocks (JFrog -25%, Okta -9.2%, SailPoint -9.4%, CrowdStrike -8%, Cloudflare -8%) -- second Anthropic-triggered selloff in Feb 2026 -- but Barclays called it "incongruent" and analysts noted "inventing a smoke detector doesn't eliminate fire departments." Scope is narrow AppSec only, does NOT replace endpoint/network/identity security. Trail of Bits adopting for security audits. Single maintainer, no benchmarks, non-deterministic. Best as complementary layer to Snyk/Semgrep/SonarQube. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-claude-code-security.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | DeepInfra (OpenRouter Provider) | Serverless AI inference platform ($28.6M raised, Felicis-backed) by ex-imo messenger engineers serving 73+ models on OpenRouter with aggressive FP4/FP8 quantization achieving the lowest prices in the market. Surprising quality despite quantization: 100% on K2 Vendor Verifier, 10/10 writing quality (beating Claude Sonnet 4's 9.5), included in OpenRouter's Exacto quality routing. Featured in NVIDIA Blackwell announcements with up to 20x cost reduction. Mid-tier speed (60-73 tok/s vs Groq's 230), zero data retention. Best cost-optimized choice for OpenRouter; use official APIs for guaranteed full-precision. | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-deepinfra-openrouter-provider.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Zvec (alibaba/zvec) | Open-source, in-process vector database from Alibaba built on Proxima -- their production engine powering Taobao, Alipay, and Youku. 7,220 stars in 2.5 months, positioned as "the SQLite of vector databases." Claims 8K+ QPS on VectorDBBench (2x ZillizCloud) but benchmarks are self-reported and HN experts (USearch creator, Redis creator, Simon Willison) are skeptical. Dense+sparse vectors, hybrid search, HNSW/IVF indexes, full CRUD, built-in reranking. Python/Node.js SDKs, Linux/macOS only. Strong for edge/on-device RAG; wait for independent benchmarks and v1.0 before production use. | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-zvec.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Stitch MCP (Google) | MCP server ecosystem for Google's Stitch AI UI design tool enabling coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity) to generate and retrieve UI designs programmatically. Multi-layered: Google cloud service (free), davideast/stitch-mcp (305 stars, by Google employee) as leading CLI/proxy, google-labs-code/stitch-skills (1,915 stars) for Agent Skills, plus community alternatives. Authentication friction and a critical state sync bug (generated screens invisible until manually opened in browser) are the main barriers. Free, rapidly evolving (20 commits/week), complementary to Figma MCP. Best free option for AI-assisted prototyping; skip for production design quality. | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-stitch-mcp.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Code Simplifier Plugin (Anthropic) | Official first-party Claude Code plugin by Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator) within the anthropics/claude-plugins-official repo (8,137 stars). A ~3KB markdown prompt that refactors recently modified code for clarity while preserving functionality, part of Boris's develop-simplify-verify workflow. Three significant unfixed bugs: alters string literals, rewrites non-code files, and hardcodes ES/React conventions. Community PRs auto-closed. The real value is the workflow pattern (dedicated simplification pass in fresh context), not the prompt itself. Use as-is for JS/TS; copy and customize for other languages. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-code-simplifier-plugin.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Web Research Assistant (elad12390) | Most feature-rich SearXNG MCP server with 13 tools (search, package registries, GitHub, error translation, API docs, tech comparison, changelogs, service status for 120+ services), 4 resources, and 5 prompts -- far broader than search-only competitors. Python, MIT, v0.3.0. However, only 6 GitHub stars and ~53 PyPI downloads/month vs dominant ihor-sokoliuk/mcp-searxng (481 stars). Zero community visibility, single contributor, last commit 52 days ago. Ambitious scope but unproven; prefer Tavily (cloud) or ihor-sokoliuk (self-hosted) for reliability. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-web-research-assistant.md) |
| 2026-02-25 | ChatGPT for Presentation Making | ChatGPT is the best AI for presentation content (outlining, narrative, speaker notes) but poor at actual slide design — Agent Mode PPTX is "rudimentary" (OpenAI's own words), GPT-5.2 Canvas produces decent HTML slides but not native PPTX. A thriving wrapper ecosystem has emerged: Twistly (3M+ users, PPT add-in), SlidesGPT, SlidesAI, Plus AI, ChatSlide.ai. Reddit consensus: use ChatGPT for thinking, then Gamma/Skywork/Beautiful.ai for slides. Claude PPTX Skill and Gamma outperform ChatGPT for end-to-end slide generation. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-25-chatgpt-for-presentation-making.md) |

| 2026-02-23 | Claude Squad (smtg-ai) | Go-based terminal app (6,111 stars) managing multiple AI coding agents in parallel via tmux sessions + git worktrees. Created by Mufeez Amjad (Linear, ex-Meta) and Jayant Shrivastava. O'Reilly Radar and Addy Osmani (Google) cite it as a pioneer in agent orchestration. However, last commit Dec 24, 2025 -- may be abandoned. Being overtaken by VibeKanban (20.4K stars, YC-backed) and native Agent Teams. Simple and elegant but market has moved on. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-claude-squad.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Claude-Flow (ruvnet) | Most-starred (14.4K) and most-downloaded (563K npm) Claude Code orchestration framework with 60+ agents, 170+ MCP tools, SONA self-learning router, and multi-provider swarm coordination (Claude + Codex + Gemini + Ollama). Extraordinary claims (84.8% SWE-Bench, "Ranked #1") remain unverified; Reddit deeply skeptical. SPARC methodology and multi-provider orchestration are real value buried under marketing excess. 99.6% single-maintainer commits. Best for experienced devs needing multi-LLM swarms; most should use native Agent Teams instead. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-claude-flow.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | LangGraph | Graph-based agent orchestration framework (24,968 stars, MIT) by LangChain Inc ($1.25B valuation). Models workflows as stateful directed graphs with durable execution, checkpointing, and human-in-the-loop. v1.0.9, used by Klarna, Replit, Elastic, LinkedIn. New Functional API (Jan 2026) and Deep Agents (9.5K stars). Most mature Python agent orchestration but steep learning curve and framework confusion. De facto standard for complex production agents; evaluate CrewAI for simpler role-based patterns. | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-langgraph.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | CrewAI | Open-source Python multi-agent framework (44.5K stars, MIT, $18M raised, ~$100M valuation) with role-based agent design (roles, goals, backstories) and two-layer Crews + Flows architecture. 100K+ certified developers, independent of LangChain. De facto standard for role-based multi-agent systems -- fastest time-to-production for standard workflows. Community consensus: best for prototyping and role-based pipelines but production hardening still maturing. Evaluate LangGraph for complex workflows, Agno for maximum simplicity. | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-crewai.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | basic-memory | Local-first knowledge management MCP server (2,552 stars, AGPL-3.0) storing AI conversations as structured Markdown files with WikiLink knowledge graph, SQLite indexing, and local vector search via fastembed. Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, Obsidian. Markdown-native bidirectional system where humans and AI read/write the same files. Reddit-recommended local-first alternative to Mem0. Very active (v0.18.5). Open SQL injection vulnerability (#591) and single-maintainer concentration are main concerns. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-basic-memory.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | claude-supermemory (Supermemory) | Claude Code plugin by $2.6M-funded startup (Susa Ventures, Jeff Dean) providing cross-platform persistent memory via cloud API. 2,178 stars in 32 days. Thin client (~200 lines) with graph-based memory, hybrid search, and memory decay server-side. Key differentiator: shared memory across Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, and Claude Desktop. Requires $19/mo Pro plan (vs free alternatives). Self-published benchmarks (81.6% LongMemEval) unverified. Good for cross-platform teams; free alternatives suffice for single-tool use. | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-claude-supermemory.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | LightRAG | Open-source graph-based RAG framework (28,552 stars, MIT, EMNLP 2025) by HKU Data Intelligence Lab. Dual-level retrieval (entity-specific + concept-level) using 6,000x fewer tokens than Microsoft GraphRAG. 200+ academic citations, 6 query modes, supports Neo4j/PostgreSQL/Milvus/Qdrant backends. Real-world deployment showed 94% cost reduction vs OpenAI API. Most popular open-source graph RAG implementation. Name collision warning: unrelated SylphAI/LightRAG project exists. Production-viable for well-scoped use cases; expect prompt customization investment. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-lightrag.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Qwen3-TTS | Alibaba's open-source TTS model family (8,357 stars, Apache 2.0) with five models (0.6B-1.7B) covering voice generation, voice design from text descriptions, and 3-second voice cloning across 10 languages. SOTA benchmarks (WER 1.24, speaker similarity 0.789), 97ms streaming latency, 542 ecosystem repos in 33 days. Chinese/CJK quality world-class; English has "anime-like quality" per community. Free local deployment vs ElevenLabs $5-99/mo. Requires NVIDIA CUDA (8-16GB VRAM). Most comprehensive open-source TTS release available. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-qwen3-tts.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Kagi Search | Premium ad-free search engine (65,564 subscribers, 1M+ daily queries) by Vladimir Prelovac. Users pay $10/mo for clean results with no tracking. The Verge: "better than Google"; Ars Technica: "dumped Google's enshittified search." Surfaces independent content (HouseFresh #1 where Google ranks #64). Growing platform: Assistant, Translate, Kids, Orion Browser, Small Web. "Search costs more than AI" inversion paradox creates economic pressure. Beloved by power users but 65K subscriber ceiling and $10/mo barrier limit mass adoption. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-kagi-search.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Figma Make | Figma's built-in AI design-to-code tool powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet, converting prompts/screenshots/frames into interactive React/HTML prototypes. 70% QoQ WAU growth, 50%+ of large customers using weekly. 12+ MCP connectors (Notion, Jira, GitHub). "Code to Canvas" partnership with Anthropic enables bidirectional Claude Code-to-Figma flow. Generates code, not editable Figma layers (that's "First Draft"). Reddit designers frustrated it "misses the point." Expert score: 58/100 for design work. Strategically essential for Figma; practically useful for rapid interactive demos. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-figma-make.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Qdrant | Rust-based open-source vector database (29K stars, Apache-2.0, $37.8M raised) with advanced filtering, hybrid search (Weighted RRF), multitenancy, and generous free tier (1GB forever). v1.17.0 (Feb 20, 2026) adds Relevance Feedback and audit logging. Consistently ranked top-3 alongside Pinecone and Milvus. Official MCP server (1,236 stars) for Claude. pgvectorscale's 11.4x QPS advantage is the main competitive threat. Strongest open-source VDB for teams needing advanced filtering without Milvus-level complexity. | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-qdrant.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Milvus | Most widely adopted open-source vector database (42,940 stars, Apache-2.0, $113M Zilliz-funded) for billion-scale ANN search. LF AI & Data Foundation graduated project. GPU-accelerated (NVIDIA CAGRA), RaBitQ 1-bit quantization (3.8x QPS at 94.7% recall), hybrid dense+sparse+BM25 search. Used by Salesforce, PayPal, NVIDIA, Airbnb, eBay. Three-tier deployment (Lite via pip to Kubernetes). Critical CVE-2026-26190 (CVSS 9.8) patched Feb 2026. Undisputed at billion-scale; Qdrant or pgvector better for sub-100M vectors. | Mixed-to-Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-milvus.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | Kiro (AWS AI IDE) | AWS's agentic AI IDE built on Code-OSS introducing spec-driven development -- transforms prompts into EARS requirements, design docs, and dependency-aware task lists before generating code. Powered by Claude via Bedrock with open-weight model support. Only major AI IDE treating specs as first-class artifacts. Controversial "Kiro Mandate" memo and Dec 2025 AWS outage incident (13 hours, autonomous environment deletion). Free tier essentially useless (50 credits). Best for enterprise/regulated AWS teams valuing structure over speed; too immature for production. | Mixed | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-kiro.md) |
| 2026-02-23 | ccusage | De facto standard CLI tool (10,942 stars, MIT, ~95K npm downloads/month) for Claude Code token usage tracking by ryoppippi. Reads local JSONL session files, generates daily/monthly/session/block reports with cost estimates. Zero-install via `npx ccusage@latest`. Spawned 20+ ecosystem integrations (macOS menu bar, tmux, Neovim, VS Code, Raycast, Slack) plus Rust/Go/Python reimplementations. Endorsed by @claude_code community account. Screenshots became social currency in Claude Code community. Cost estimates are approximations, not actual billing. Single maintainer (bus factor 1). | Positive | [Report](catalogue/2026-02-23-ccusage.md) |
