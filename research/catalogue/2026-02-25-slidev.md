# Slidev: Research Report

## Overview

Slidev (sli.dev) is the leading open-source, Markdown-based presentation framework for developers, created by Anthony Fu — a Vue, Nuxt, and Vite core team member also known for Vitest, VueUse, and UnoCSS. With 44,467 GitHub stars (2.5x Marp's ~17.8K), 66K npm downloads/month, and 5 releases in the last 6 weeks (latest v52.12.0, Feb 12, 2026), it is the most actively maintained and feature-rich tool in the developer-slides category.

What distinguishes Slidev from competitors isn't just Markdown support — it's the full power of the Vue/Vite ecosystem embedded in a presentation tool. Slides can contain interactive Vue components, live coding via Monaco Editor, Mermaid diagrams, KaTeX math, UnoCSS styling, and Iconify icons. The result is slides that feel like web applications, not static decks.

The most significant 2026 development is the emergence of an **AI agent skills ecosystem** specifically targeting Slidev. Multiple independent teams have built Claude Code skills, Cursor skills, and multi-agent workflows that use AI to generate Markdown content and Slidev to render polished presentations. This "AI content + Slidev rendering" pipeline is becoming a standard developer pattern, positioning Slidev as the de facto open-source target for AI-generated developer presentations.

This report fills the gap identified in the [AI Presentation-Creating Tools comparison](2026-02-19-presentation-creating-tools.md), where Slidev was listed as an "adjacent competitor not covered" and described as "Marp's main open-source rival."

## The AI + Slidev Ecosystem (2026 Development)

The most notable recent trend is the convergence of AI coding agents and Slidev:

### Official Support
- **sli.dev/guide/work-with-ai** — Slidev's official documentation page for AI-assisted workflows

### Agent Skills
- **yoanbernabeu/slidev-skills:** 20 AI agent skills covering syntax, layouts, animations, code highlighting, and diagrams. Compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Windsurf, and 30+ agents.
- **Smithery.ai:** create-slidev-presentation skill
- **mcpmarket.com:** Slidev Presentations Claude Code Skill
- **kaovilai/k8s-cbt-s3mover-demo:** Slidev skill for specific domain presentations

### Workflow Pattern
The emerging standard is:
1. AI agent generates structured Markdown content (outlines, code examples, speaker notes)
2. Slidev renders it into interactive, polished presentations
3. Developer iterates in VS Code with AI assistance
4. Export to PDF/PPTX for sharing

### Coverage
- **elite-ai-assisted-coding.dev** (Feb 11, 2026): "Rather than trying to reinvent presentation software, the skill leverages Sli.dev (Slidev)" — describes parallel sub-agent asset generation + Slidev rendering
- **DEV Community:** "Boost Your Presentations with Claude + Slidev"
- Multiple LinkedIn posts showing Claude Code + Slidev professional workflows

## User Sentiment

**Overall:** Positive — consistently recommended as the most feature-rich markdown presentation tool for developers.

### Reddit (High confidence, 10+ threads)
- r/Slidev subreddit exists with Discord question archives
- Mentioned in r/ClaudeAI, r/Markdown, r/PhdProductivity, r/GithubCopilot, r/learnjavascript, r/programming
- Key quotes:
  - "My AI slides hack is to have claude code or codex CLI make markdown slides presentable via the slidev tool, and the results are amazing" (r/ClaudeAI)
  - "When you like interactions animations and a lot of fun, use slidev. When you want simple clean slides to focus on the content, use marp" (GitHub Discussion #86)
  - r/learnjavascript 2025 comparison: Marp called "unmaintained," Slidev positioned as the active modern option
- No significant complaints about bugs, performance, or maintainer responsiveness

### Twitter/X (Low signal)
- Official @Slidevjs account exists but low recent discoverable activity
- Slidev benefits from antfu's broader X presence (100K+ followers)
- Japanese developer community shows active Slidev discussion
- Project community lives on GitHub/Discord/Reddit rather than X

### LinkedIn (Moderate signal)
- Developer advocates and conference speakers sharing Slidev enthusiastically
- AI + Slidev workflow posts gaining traction (Michael Lomuscio, Ford Lascari)
- Grassroots adoption by individual developers, not enterprise/corporate signals
- All posts positive — no LinkedIn criticism found

### Hacker News
- Frontpage discussion on initial launch (2021) — positive reception from the reveal.js/developer community

## Competitive Landscape

### Slidev vs. Marp (Direct Rival)

| Dimension | Slidev | Marp |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Stars** | 44,467 | ~17,800 (combined) |
| **Age** | 4 years | 8 years |
| **npm Downloads** | 66K/mo | ~30K/mo (marp-cli) |
| **Approach** | Vue + Markdown + Vite | Pure Markdown + Puppeteer |
| **Interactivity** | Full (Vue components, live coding) | None |
| **Styling** | UnoCSS (atomic, on-demand) | CSS directives |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate (Vue/npm knowledge) | Low (just Markdown) |
| **IDE Support** | VS Code extension + Prettier plugin | VS Code extension + JetBrains |
| **Export** | PDF, PNG, PPTX (Playwright) | PDF, PPTX, HTML, PNG (Puppeteer) |
| **Diagrams** | Mermaid, PlantUML | Via plugins |
| **Recording** | Built-in | None |
| **Presenter Mode** | Yes (incl. phone remote) | Limited |
| **AI Integration** | Official docs + 20+ agent skills | Emerging |
| **Maintainer** | antfu (Vue core team) | Yuki Hattori (solo) |
| **Community** | Discord + r/Slidev | GitHub only |

**Verdict:** Slidev wins on features, interactivity, and ecosystem breadth. Marp wins on simplicity and zero-config. Both are healthy open-source projects. For developers who present code, Slidev's live coding and Vue components are unique differentiators.

### Slidev vs. reveal.js

| Dimension | Slidev | reveal.js |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Authoring** | Markdown | HTML (primarily) |
| **Framework** | Vue 3 + Vite | Vanilla JS |
| **Customization** | Vue components + UnoCSS | HTML/CSS/JS |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | High |
| **Stars** | 44,467 | ~68,000 |
| **Community Age** | 4 years | 13+ years |

reveal.js has more raw stars and longer history but Slidev has surpassed it in developer experience for Markdown-first workflows.

### Slidev vs. AI Presentation Tools (Gamma, PPTX Skill)

| Dimension | Slidev | Gamma | Claude PPTX Skill |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **Type** | OSS framework | AI SaaS | AI skill |
| **Users** | ~66K/mo developers | 30M+ | Enterprise |
| **AI Role** | Rendering backend | Full generation | Full generation |
| **Output** | Web/PDF/PNG/PPTX | Web/PDF/PPTX | Native PPTX |
| **Design Quality** | Developer-polished | Best visual | Good |
| **Interactivity** | Full (Vue, live coding) | Static | Static |
| **Version Control** | Git-native | No | No |
| **Cost** | Free (MIT) | $0-20/mo | Free tier |
| **Best For** | Dev presentations | Business decks | Enterprise/consulting |

Slidev occupies a different niche — it's a presentation *framework*, not a presentation *generator*. AI tools complement it rather than compete with it.

### Where Slidev Fits in the Ecosystem

                         ↓
                    Less Interactive
```

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Most-starred markdown presentation tool (44.5K) | Requires Node.js + npm knowledge |
| Full Vue/Vite ecosystem power | Steeper learning curve than Marp |
| Live coding with Monaco Editor | PPTX export less polished than native PPTX tools |
| Built-in recording, drawing, presenter mode | Vue-specific — not framework-agnostic |
| Active development (5 releases in 6 weeks) | Single-maintainer dominant (78% commits) |
| Growing AI agent skills ecosystem | Not for non-developer audiences |
| MIT license, no vendor lock-in | Requires running a dev server (not just a file) |
| Official "Work with AI" documentation | Smaller community than reveal.js |
| npm theme/addon ecosystem | Puppeteer/Playwright needed for export |
| Git-native, version-controllable | No web editor (IDE required) |

## Recommendations

**For developers giving technical talks:** Slidev is the best-in-class choice. The combination of Markdown authoring, live coding, Vue component embedding, and Vite HMR creates the most productive workflow for code-heavy presentations.

**For AI-assisted presentation creation:** The "Claude/Copilot + Slidev" pipeline is the emerging developer standard. Use yoanbernabeu/slidev-skills or the official Work with AI guide to get started.

**For teams choosing between Slidev and Marp:** Use Slidev when you need interactivity (live coding, animations, Vue components, presenter mode). Use Marp when you need maximum simplicity and zero-config Markdown-to-slides.

**For non-developers or business presentations:** Slidev is not the right tool — use Gamma, Claude PPTX Skill, or Google Slides instead. Slidev's value proposition is specifically for developer audiences.

**For conference speakers and developer advocates:** Slidev + VS Code + a good theme is a powerful combination. The presenter mode (including phone remote), built-in recording, and drawing tools cover the full live-presentation workflow.

**Bottom line:** Slidev has earned its position as the #1 developer presentation framework through exceptional engineering pedigree (antfu/Vue core team), the most complete feature set in the category, and a rapidly growing AI integration ecosystem. It's not trying to replace PowerPoint — it's building the presentation tool that developers actually want to use.
