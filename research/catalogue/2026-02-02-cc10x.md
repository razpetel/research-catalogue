# cc10x Research Report

## Overview

cc10x is a Claude Code plugin that positions itself as "The Intelligent Orchestrator for Claude Code." Created by romiluz13 and first released in October 2025, it takes a minimalist approach to the crowded plugin space, offering just 4 workflows, 6 agents, and 12 skills—deliberately constrained compared to competitors with 50+ skills.

The core innovation is a single router that auto-detects user intent (BUILD, DEBUG, REVIEW, or PLAN) and orchestrates the appropriate agent chain automatically. This addresses user frustration with manually selecting from overwhelming skill lists. The plugin enforces TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR), requires evidence before claiming fixes work (LOG FIRST), and maintains memory across Claude Code context compaction via persistent markdown files in `.claude/cc10x/`.

With 69 stars and 5 forks as of February 2026, cc10x is smaller than competitors like Oh My Claude Code (4,000+ stars) or Superpowers. However, it's actively maintained with multiple commits in the past 48 hours (v6.0.6+) and has zero open issues—suggesting either low adoption or high quality.

## Technical Analysis

### Architecture
- **Router-first design**: Single entry point detects intent from trigger words
- **Agent chains**: Sequential/parallel execution (e.g., BUILD → component-builder → [code-reviewer ∥ silent-failure-hunter] → integration-verifier)
- **Memory persistence**: `.claude/cc10x/activeContext.md`, `patterns.md`, `progress.md`
- **Task-based orchestration**: Uses Claude Code's Tasks system for workflow coordination

### Key Components
| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| cc10x-router | Intent detection, workflow routing |
| component-builder | TDD-enforced feature building |
| bug-investigator | LOG FIRST debugging |
| code-reviewer | ≥80% confidence scoring |
| silent-failure-hunter | Empty catch block detection |
| integration-verifier | E2E validation with exit codes |
| planner | Comprehensive planning with external research |

### Installation
```bash
/plugin marketplace add romiluz13/cc10x
/plugin install cc10x@romiluz13
```

Recommended: Copy `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` to project root for persistent router activation.

## User Sentiment

**Overall:** Insufficient data (minimal direct mentions)

- **Reddit:** No direct cc10x discussions found. Related Claude Code plugin sentiment is mixed—users appreciate workflow enforcement but note token-heavy execution and preference for maintaining custom skills over community plugins.
- **Twitter/X:** No direct mentions found in the past month. Minimal social presence despite GitHub activity.
- **LinkedIn:** No professional mentions. Enterprise adoption unclear.

## Competitive Landscape

cc10x competes in a crowded Claude Code orchestration space:

| Competitor | Stars | Differentiation |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| Oh My Claude Code (OMC) | 4,041 | 5 execution modes, 32 agents, smart model routing |
| Superpowers | N/A | Popular, enforces TDD/subagents/planning |
| workflow-orchestrator | N/A | Hooks-based architecture-level enforcement |
| Alfred the Butler | N/A | Prompt-based orchestration identity |

### cc10x's Value Proposition
- **Minimalism**: 4 workflows vs dozens elsewhere
- **Auto-routing**: No manual skill selection
- **Opinionated TDD**: Non-negotiable RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- **Memory persistence**: Survives context compaction

### Weaknesses vs Competitors
- Smaller community (69 vs 4,000+ stars)
- Less feature richness (no Autopilot, Swarm, etc.)
- Single maintainer dependency
- Minimal documentation/marketing presence

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Simple, opinionated workflow (4 modes) | Small community, limited adoption |
| Auto-intent detection (no manual selection) | Single maintainer risk |
| TDD enforcement built-in | Less flexible than feature-rich alternatives |
| Memory persistence across sessions | No social proof (minimal Reddit/Twitter) |
| Active development (commits daily) | Unproven at scale |
| Zero open issues | May be too rigid for some workflows |
| MIT licensed | Token-heavy agent chains |

## Recommendation

**For minimalists and TDD purists**: cc10x is worth exploring if you're frustrated by bloated plugins with too many skills. Its auto-routing and TDD enforcement match a specific, disciplined development style.

**For power users**: Consider Oh My Claude Code or Superpowers for more execution modes and larger community support.

**For production teams**: Wait for more community validation. Single maintainer and 69 stars is early-stage.
