# awesome-claude-skills (Composio)

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**URL:** https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills
**Sentiment:** Mixed

## Summary

ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills is the largest curated list of Claude Skills with 30.5K GitHub stars, backed by $29M-funded startup Composio. It organizes 70+ skills across 9 categories (document processing, development, data, business, etc.) and prominently features Composio's "connect-apps" plugin for 500+ app integrations. However, the repo faces attribution controversy—it appeared one day after travisvn's original list (6.6K stars), which Reddit calls "the canonical awesome-list." The repo serves dual purposes: genuine community resource and lead generation for Composio's platform.

| Repository | Stars | Position |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills** | 30,575 | Largest, corporate-backed |
| hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code | 22,893 | Broader Claude Code focus |
| travisvn/awesome-claude-skills | 6,603 | Original, community canonical |
| BehiSecc/awesome-claude-skills | 5,464 | Quality curation |
| obra/superpowers | 42,400 | Workflow enforcement (different category) |

### The Attribution Issue

Reddit noted: "This is the Composio fork of travisvn's repo, which has been around for months and is basically the canonical awesome-list for Claude skills."

Timeline:
- 2025-10-16: travisvn creates repo
- 2025-10-17: ComposioHQ version appears (one day later)

## User Sentiment

**Overall:** Mixed

### Reddit
- **Positive:** "Connects to like 500+ apps... workflow automation has been as smooth as possible"
- **Negative:** Attribution controversy, "awesome list fatigue"
- **Recommendation:** travisvn's repo cited as canonical; BehiSecc's collection praised for quality

### Twitter
- Minimal presence for the awesome-list specifically
- Composio company active on @composio but repo doesn't generate buzz

### LinkedIn
- Professional context around Composio's enterprise positioning
- Limited discussion of the awesome-list as standalone resource

## Key Differentiators

**vs. travisvn (original):**
- Composio's version has 4.6x more stars
- Corporate backing, more marketing
- Prominent Composio product placement

**vs. obra/superpowers:**
- Superpowers is workflow enforcement (brainstorm→plan→TDD→review)
- awesome-claude-skills is skill discovery/curation
- Complementary rather than competing

**vs. Chat2AnyLLM (8,246 skills):**
- Composio is curated, Chat2AnyLLM is comprehensive
- Quality vs. quantity tradeoff

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Largest collection by stars | Attribution controversy with original |
| Well-organized categories | Corporate marketing embedded |
| Active maintenance | Quantity focus may dilute quality |
| Composio integration useful | Competes with community-driven alternatives |
| Apache 2.0 license | Many skills just link to other repos |

## Comparison to obra/superpowers (Prior Research)

The 2026-02-02 research on obra/superpowers (42.4K stars) covered workflow enforcement—teaching Claude TDD, debugging, and code review. awesome-claude-skills serves a different purpose: skill discovery and external tool integration.

**Recommendation:** Use both:
- **superpowers** for development discipline (brainstorm, plan, TDD, review)
- **awesome-claude-skills** for finding specific task skills (PDF processing, AWS, etc.)
- **travisvn's list** if preferring community-canonical source

## Bottom Line

ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills is the largest skills directory by star count, backed by a well-funded startup. It's useful for discovering skills and integrating Claude with external apps via Composio. However, the attribution controversy and corporate marketing angle mean discerning users may prefer travisvn's original community-driven list. For workflow enforcement, obra/superpowers remains the standard. Use Composio's list for discovery and their connect-apps plugin if you need 500+ app integrations; use travisvn or BehiSecc for community-curated recommendations.
