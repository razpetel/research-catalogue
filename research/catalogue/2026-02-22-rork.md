# Rork Research Report

## Overview

Rork is an AI-powered no-code mobile app builder founded in 2024 by Daniel Dhawan (27, SF) and Levan Kvirkvelia (25, Tbilisi), who previously co-created 21st.dev (50K users, 3K GitHub stars, #1 Product Hunt of the Month). The platform converts plain-English descriptions into complete React Native/Expo mobile apps via a conversational chat interface. It raised a $2.8M pre-seed from a16z Speedrun (Andrew Chen), Hustle Fund, Expo co-founders, and angel Matt Shumer -- whose viral tweet ("My jaw just DROPPED... Rork blows Bolt out of the water") generated $450K in same-day investments and catalyzed the entire round from near-bankruptcy ($15K credit card debt, depleted savings).

Rork now operates two product lines: **Rork Pro** (React Native/Expo, cross-platform iOS+Android+Web, powered by GPT-5) and the just-launched **Rork Max** (Feb 19, 2026 -- native Swift/SwiftUI for all Apple platforms including Vision Pro, powered by Claude Opus 4.6 + Claude Code on cloud Mac clusters). The startup reached $1M ARR in ~3 months with just 4 people, has 743K+ monthly website visits, and 1,168+ user-generated repositories on GitHub. However, beneath the impressive growth metrics lies significant community polarization: Reddit is awash with complaints about buggy code, broken App Store publishing, a "predatory" credit system, absent customer support, and aggressive astroturfing that has actively damaged trust.

## Technical Analysis

**Rork Pro (React Native) Generated Stack:**
- Expo SDK 54 / React Native 0.81 / React 19
- expo-router v6, Zustand v5 (state), TanStack React Query v5 (data)
- Convex for real-time backend
- Proprietary `@rork-ai/toolkit-sdk` and `bunx rork start` CLI
- Maestro E2E test scaffolding, Bun package manager
- EAS (Expo Application Services) for builds and App Store submission

**Rork Max (Swift/Native):**
- Swift + SwiftUI, compiled on cloud Mac clusters
- Claude Opus 4.6 + Claude Code for generation
- Targets: iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Vision Pro
- Claimed capabilities: AR (ARKit), widgets, Live Activities, Dynamic Island, LiDAR, CarPlay, Siri, Apple Health

**Platform:** Closed-source SaaS (no public GitHub repo). Web platform built with Next.js. Chat-only interface (no visual editor). The `rorkagent` GitHub bot (created Nov 2025) pushes generated code to users' repos.

**Critical technical concerns:**
- Generated apps use outdated/deprecated packages causing build failures at App Store submission
- AI frequently gets stuck in "thinking" loops, consuming credits without output
- No manual code editing in web IDE -- users must export to GitHub and fix in Claude Code/Cursor
- Rork Max's "native Swift" claim is disputed: Reddit users report it still uses React Native/Expo under the hood despite Swift marketing
- Backend support is essentially manual (Supabase/Firebase integration left to the user)

## User Sentiment

**Overall: Mixed (trending negative among experienced users)**

### Reddit (Polarized, trending negative)
35+ threads across 16 subreddits. Non-developers initially impressed by speed ("3 functional apps in 15 minutes"), but frustration dominates once users try to publish or build anything beyond demos. Experienced iOS engineer (8 years) ranked it #2 behind Vibecode but noted credit model and non-native limitations. Major astroturfing problem: identical copy-paste promotional comments found across 8+ subreddits, with community actively calling it out ("Is this Rork hype REAL or BS?"). Key complaints: broken publishing, predatory credits, buggy output, absent support.

### Twitter (Overwhelmingly positive, influencer-driven)
Matt Shumer remains the most prominent evangelist with 5+ dedicated tweets and 1M+ views on the original viral tweet. Rork Max launch (Feb 19, 2026) generated significant buzz from @PrajwalTomar_, @ErnestoSOFTWARE, and @richsongocrazy. The Twitter conversation is one-sided positive -- all skepticism lives on Reddit and Medium. Signs of coordinated influencer marketing strategy (Reddit users note "many top indie hackers are promoting it day and night").

### LinkedIn (Professional, growth-narrative)
Company page at linkedin.com/company/rork-app. ~12 notable posts from Mar 2025 to Feb 2026 tracking the growth story: viral tweet → a16z funding → $1M ARR → Rork Agent → Rork Max. Founders position it as "the Lovable for mobile apps." App reached top-5 in 47 countries on Apple charts. Team remains tiny (~4-6 people).

## Competitive Landscape

| Tool | Focus | AI Model | App Store Publish | Backend | Pricing From |
|------|-------|----------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Rork Pro** | Mobile (RN/Expo) | GPT-5 | Yes (built-in) | Manual | $20/mo |
| **Rork Max** | Apple native (Swift) | Claude Opus 4.6 | Yes (2-click) | Manual | TBD |
| **Lovable** | Web apps | Various | No | Built-in | ~$20/mo |
| **Bolt.new** | Full-stack web | Various | No | Built-in | ~$20/mo |
| **v0 (Vercel)** | UI/web components | Various | No | No | ~$20/mo |
| **FlutterFlow** | Mobile (Flutter) | N/A (drag-drop) | Yes | Built-in | $30/mo |
| **Vibecode** | Mobile | Various | Yes | Unknown | Varies |

**Rork's niche:** The only major AI builder focused specifically on mobile apps with direct App Store publishing. "By far the best front end" (AquaVoice Showdown) but "the backend was a bit of a dumpster fire." The recommended community workflow involves prototyping in Rork → exporting to GitHub → fixing in Claude Code/Cursor → publishing, which undermines the no-code promise.

## Pricing

| Plan | Price/mo | Credits/mo | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Free | $0 | 35 (5/day) | Limited features |
| Junior | $20 | 100 | Basic paid tier |
| Middle | $50 | 250 | Private projects, code editor, GitHub, chat support |
| Senior | $100 | 500 | -- |
| Scale 1K | $200 | 1,000 | Power users |
| Custom | Contact | Custom | Enterprise |

- Flat ~$0.20/credit across all tiers. No rollover. Each prompt = 1 credit regardless of complexity.
- Rork Max pricing not yet public.
- Additional: Expo EAS fees, Apple Developer ($99/yr), Google Play ($25).

## Founding Story

One of the more dramatic origin stories in recent startup history. Dhawan and Kvirkvelia -- immigrants who met at MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology) -- were nearly broke after two prior startups when angel investor Matt Shumer tried Rork, invested immediately, and posted his viral tweet on Feb 24, 2025. Within 15 minutes, Austen Allred put in $100K. By end of day, $450K was committed. This led to a16z Speedrun acceptance and the $2.8M round (TechCrunch, May 2025). Both founders had been building hit apps since their teens; Dhawan had an app reach #2 on the App Store, and Kvirkvelia wrote one of the best-performing ad algorithms at Yandex.

## Red Flags

1. **Astroturfing:** Identical promotional comments copy-pasted across 8+ Reddit subreddits. Community actively suspicious. This has backfired -- organic discussions are now polluted with distrust.
2. **Misleading Rork Max marketing:** Advertised as "native Swift/SwiftUI" but community members report it still uses React Native/Expo under the hood. The `@rork-ai/toolkit-sdk` npm package appears in Max-generated projects.
3. **Credit system complaints:** Auto-subscriptions, disappearing credit counters, credits consumed by AI stuck in thinking loops, no refunds. Multiple Reddit threads label it "predatory."
4. **Broken publishing:** The core value proposition (App Store publishing) frequently fails due to outdated packages and build configuration errors. Users need developer help to actually ship.
5. **Absent customer support:** Consistent complaint across all sources. "One simple question takes HOURS to respond."
6. **Trustpilot 2.9/5:** Low rating with limited but negative reviews.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Only major AI mobile app builder (owns the niche) | Buggy code output, especially beyond simple apps |
| Best-in-class frontend/UI generation | Backend is essentially absent ("dumpster fire") |
| $0→$1M ARR in 3 months (real traction) | App Store publishing frequently broken |
| a16z-backed with strong founder story | Credit system widely called "predatory" |
| 1,168+ repos generated (proven adoption) | Customer support is absent |
| Rork Max vision (all Apple platforms) is ambitious | Rork Max "native Swift" claims are disputed |
| Code export to GitHub (you own the code) | No manual code editing in web IDE |
| React Native/Expo is a proven foundation | Uses outdated/deprecated packages |
| 743K+ monthly visits, 47-country top-5 | Significant astroturfing damages trust |
| Free tier available (35 credits/mo) | No credit rollover, credits wasted on "thinking" loops |
