# Qdrant Research Report

## Overview

Qdrant is an open-source, Rust-based vector database and search engine (29,026 GitHub stars, 2,051 forks, Apache-2.0) built by a Berlin-based startup of the same name. Founded in 2020 by Andre Zayarni and Andrey Vasnetsov, the company has raised $37.8M in total funding ($28M Series A led by Spark Capital in January 2024, with participation from Unusual Ventures and 42CAP) and employs 114 people as of January 2026. Qdrant provides high-performance vector similarity search with an extensive feature set including dense and sparse vectors, hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, advanced metadata filtering, multitenancy, and distributed clustering -- all exposed through REST and gRPC APIs with official clients in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, and .NET.

The latest release, v1.17.0 (February 20, 2026), is a significant feature release introducing Relevance Feedback for iterative search refinement, Weighted RRF for advanced hybrid search tuning, audit access logging, secondary API keys for zero-downtime rotation, a dedicated metrics port, and unlimited update queue handling. Prior releases in 2025 added tiered multitenancy with tenant promotion (v1.16), disk-efficient vector search with inline storage (v1.16), ACORN filtered search (v1.16), and advanced quantization and full-text filtering (v1.15). Qdrant is also transitioning its storage backend from RocksDB to the purpose-built Gridstore, with RocksDB support being fully removed in v1.18.

Qdrant occupies a strong position in the vector database market, consistently ranked in the top 3 alongside Pinecone and Milvus across multiple independent comparison guides (Firecrawl, Shakudo, DataCamp, JishuLabs, Liveblocks). However, the broader industry narrative is shifting: Estuary's February 2026 article "The Vector Database Hype is Over" argues that PostgreSQL extensions like pgvectorscale are absorbing vector search capabilities, with benchmarks showing 471 QPS vs Qdrant's 41 QPS at 99% recall on 50M vectors. Qdrant's counter-position is that specialized databases still dominate for billion-scale deployments, sub-millisecond latency, advanced hybrid search, and production-grade multitenancy -- features that PostgreSQL extensions don't yet match.

## Technical Analysis

### Architecture
- **Language**: Rust (performance + memory safety)
- **Storage**: Transitioning from RocksDB to custom Gridstore engine; supports in-memory, mmap, and disk-based storage
- **Indexing**: Custom HNSW implementation, IVF, flat index
- **Consensus**: Raft-based for distributed deployments
- **API**: REST (OpenAPI v3) + gRPC, with official clients in 6 languages

### Core Features
| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Vector Types** | Dense, sparse, multi-vector (ColBERT late interaction), named vectors |
| **Search** | Semantic, hybrid (dense+sparse+RRF), filtered, recommendation, discovery, relevance feedback (v1.17) |
| **Quantization** | Scalar, product, binary -- significant memory savings |
| **Multitenancy** | Payload-based tenant isolation, tiered multitenancy with tenant promotion (v1.16) |
| **Hybrid Search** | Dense + Sparse + RRF fusion, Weighted RRF (v1.17), BM25 via sparse vectors |
| **Filtering** | Rich metadata filtering with full-text search, geo-spatial queries |
| **Cloud Inference** | Built-in embedding + reranking (no external API needed) |
| **Distributed** | Sharding, replication, horizontal scaling, delayed fan-outs for tail latency |

### Recent Release Highlights

**v1.17.0 (Feb 20, 2026)**:
- Relevance Feedback for iterative search refinement
- Weighted RRF for fine-tuned hybrid search
- Audit Access Logging for compliance
- Secondary API Keys for zero-downtime rotation
- Dedicated Metrics Port (separate from main API)
- Unlimited Update Queue (handles write spikes)
- Update Mode parameter (explicit insert/update/upsert)
- Shard Key Listing API

**v1.16.0 (Nov 2025)**:
- Tiered Multitenancy with tenant promotion
- Disk-Efficient Vector Search with Inline Storage
- ACORN filtered vector search algorithm

### Ecosystem
- **Official MCP Server**: qdrant/mcp-server-qdrant (1,236 stars, 234 forks) -- Claude integration via Model Context Protocol
- **Framework Integrations**: LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, Spring AI, CrewAI
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, GCP, Azure Marketplace availability
- **Kubernetes**: Official Helm charts (qdrant/qdrant-helm)
- **Context7 Coverage**: 5,034 code snippets, High reputation, 89.3/100 benchmark score

### Benchmark Performance
| Metric | Qdrant | pgvectorscale | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------|
| p50 Latency | 30.75ms | 31.07ms | Comparable |
| QPS @ 99% Recall | 41 QPS | 471 QPS | pgvectorscale 11.4x advantage (50M vectors) |
| Competitive | Zilliz, Pinecone | -- | Zilliz leads in raw latency |

Note: Benchmark methodology varies significantly. Qdrant publishes its own benchmark framework at qdrant.tech/benchmarks showing different results. Each vendor's benchmarks favor their own product.

## User Sentiment

**Overall: Mixed-to-Positive**

- **Reddit**: Praised for ease of setup, filtering capabilities, and free tier. Cost concerns at scale (primarily AWS infrastructure costs, not Qdrant itself). Growing competition from pgvector. Community consistently recommends it for open-source vector search needs.
- **Twitter/X**: Stable presence as part of the "big 4" vector databases. Limited recent data due to X platform instability. Growing counter-narrative from pgvector advocates.
- **LinkedIn**: 5,943 followers, 82 job listings. Recognized as top GenAI startup in Europe. Deep technical analysis articles by PhD researchers. Strong enterprise presence.

### Community Themes
1. **"Easy to start"**: Quick setup via Docker, generous free tier, good documentation
2. **"Best filtering"**: Sophisticated metadata filtering widely praised as best-in-class
3. **"Cost at scale"**: Infrastructure costs (AWS/GCP) accumulate; not Qdrant-specific
4. **"No native BM25"**: Hybrid search requires sparse vector workaround, not built-in BM25 like Weaviate
5. **"pgvector is catching up"**: Growing sentiment that PostgreSQL extensions may be "good enough"

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
| Competitor | Differentiation | When to Choose Over Qdrant |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Pinecone** | Fully managed, zero ops, consistent low latency | Zero ops budget, willing to pay premium |
| **Milvus/Zilliz** | Billion-scale, GPU acceleration, most features | 100M+ vectors, need GPU-accelerated indexing |
| **Weaviate** | Built-in ML modules, GraphQL, native BM25 hybrid | Need native hybrid search + ML integration |
| **pgvector/pgvectorscale** | PostgreSQL extension, no separate service | Already have Postgres, don't need advanced features |
| **Chroma** | Simplest setup, great for prototyping | Quick prototypes, not production scale |
| **Zvec (Alibaba)** | Embedded/in-process, claims 2x QPS | Edge/on-device RAG, embedded use case |

### Industry Narrative: "The Vector DB Hype is Over"
A significant February 2026 narrative shift sees traditional databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) adding vector capabilities. The argument: vector search is becoming "just another index type," commoditizing the basic use case. Qdrant's counter-position is that specialized databases still dominate for:
- Advanced multitenancy at scale
- Sub-millisecond latency requirements
- Sophisticated hybrid search (dense + sparse + late interaction + RRF)
- Production reliability with distributed consensus
- Enterprise features (audit logging, key rotation, metrics isolation)
