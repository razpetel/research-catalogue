# Gas Town (steveyegge/gastown)

**Research Date:** February 4, 2026
**Category:** AI Coding Tools / Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Repository:** https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown
**Prior Research:** [Beads (2026-02-03)](2026-02-03-beads-steve-yegge.md) - Gas Town mentioned as using Beads infrastructure

## TL;DR

Gas Town is Steve Yegge's multi-agent orchestration system for coordinating 20-30 Claude Code instances in parallel. With 8.1K stars in 7 weeks and 3,221 commits, it represents the most ambitious attempt at "Kubernetes for AI agents." The system uses role-based architecture (Mayor, Polecats, Refinery, etc.) with git-backed state persistence via Beads. However, significant controversy surrounds the project: the BAGS/GAS token pump-and-dump, Yegge's admission of merging "44k lines of code no human looked at," and reports of $100/hour token burn rates. The architectural vision is sound but Gas Town is firmly experimental—designed only for "Stage 7-8" developers already comfortable running 5-10 agents. Most teams should master single-agent workflows first; watch from a distance unless you're on the agentic frontier.

## What It Is

Gas Town is a workspace manager that coordinates multiple Claude Code agents across different tasks, persisting work state through git-backed hooks. Created by Steve Yegge (ex-Amazon, ex-Google, ex-Sourcegraph), it launched January 1, 2026 with the tagline "Kubernetes for agents."

**Core Philosophy:** The era of the IDE is ending; the era of the Agent Factory has begun. Gas Town elevates developers from writing code to orchestrating AI workers—essentially becoming "CEO" of an algorithmic software company.

## Architecture

Gas Town uses an elaborate role-based metaphor drawn from Mad Max and _Slow Horses_:

```
Town Level (global, ~/gt/)
├── Mayor - Primary AI coordinator with full workspace context
├── Deacon - Health monitoring, patrol executor
└── Dogs - Background heartbeat monitors (watching the watchers)

Rig Level (per-project)
├── Witness - Worker manager, stuck detection
├── Refinery - Merge queue processor
├── Polecats - Transient ephemeral worker agents
├── Crew - Persistent workers (human workspace)
├── Hooks - Git worktree-based persistent storage
└── Convoys - Work tracking units bundling multiple issues
```

**Key Innovation:** External memory via Beads rather than context pollution. Each agent works in isolated git worktrees with deterministic handoffs, avoiding the shared-state corruption plaguing simpler multi-agent approaches.

## Installation

```bash
# Homebrew
brew install gastown

# npm
npm install -g @gastown/gt

# Go

```

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.23+, Git 2.25+, Beads (bd) 0.44.0+, SQLite3, tmux 3.0+ recommended

## The 8 Stages of Dev Evolution

Yegge's framework (widely cited across discussions):

| Stage | Description | Tools |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1-2 | AI as autocomplete | Copilot |
| 3-4 | IDE with AI features | Cursor, Windsurf |
| 5-6 | CLI agents, some parallelism | Claude Code, Codex |
| 7-8 | Orchestrating agent swarms | Gas Town |

**Important:** Gas Town explicitly gates adoption at Stage 6-7. "If you're not already comfortable running 5-10 agents manually, this will overwhelm you."

## Community Reception

### Positive (~35%)

- "Users report scaling from 5 PRs in 3 hours to 36 in 4 hours" - Aviator Blog
- Adrian Cockcroft (ex-Netflix/AWS VP), Adam Jacob (Chef co-founder) shared on LinkedIn
- DoltHub: favorable review from former Amazon colleague
- Recognized as pushing multi-agent orchestration boundaries

### Skeptical/Negative (~50%)

- "Beads makes me feel like my computer has AIDS. Same with Gas Town." - r/ClaudeCode
- "Reads like the ramblings of a smart person experiencing a psychotic episode" - HN
- "$100/hour token burn rate at peak" - paddo.dev
- "Murderous rampaging Deacon" agent deleted code unpredictably, requiring 5 force pushes
- "Auto-merging failing tests into main" reported
- r/programmingcirclejerk mocking 189k lines of Go for the codebase
- "Fabricated terminology for standard concepts"

### Neutral (~15%)

- "Not ready for daily use, but ideas worth understanding" - EQengineered
- Comparisons to Ralph Wiggum, multiclaude as simpler alternatives

## The BAGS/GAS Token Controversy

**Timeline:**
1. Gas Town launched January 1, 2026
2. Anonymous community member created $GAS token on BAGS (Solana launchpad)
3. Token surged 500-700% as interest grew
4. Trading fees automatically routed to Yegge's verified account
5. Yegge claimed receiving $68K-$75K in "BAGS and the Creator Economy" post
6. Yegge "stepped back" on January 18; token crashed 90%
7. Similar pattern with Geoffrey Huntley's $RALPH token ($300K received)

**Critical Response:**
- Pivot to AI: "Vibe coding goes crypto scam"
- Sean Goedecke: "Crypto grifters are recruiting open-source AI developers"
- The Defiant: "GAS Tanks 90% After AI Dev 'Steps Back'"

**Yegge's Defense:** The token was created without his involvement; BAGS platform routes fees automatically. He disclosed receiving money and didn't explicitly endorse buying.

**Impact:** Crypto controversy has overshadowed technical discussion and damaged community trust.

## The Code Review Controversy

Yegge stated in "Gas Town Emergency User Manual":
> "I've merged over 100 PRs from nearly 50 contributors, adding 44k lines of code that no human has looked at."

This raised significant quality and security concerns:
- How can AI-generated code be trusted at scale?
- What vulnerabilities might exist in 44K unreviewed lines?
- Does this represent the future or recklessness?

## Strengths

1. **Architectural Vision:** External memory, deterministic handoffs, environment isolation
2. **Active Development:** 3,221 commits in 50 days, responsive maintainer
3. **Real Problem:** Multi-agent coordination is genuinely difficult
4. **Beads Integration:** Proven task tracking infrastructure
5. **Multiple Runtimes:** Claude, Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Auggie, Amp support
6. **Git-Native:** Appeals to developers wanting version-controlled state

## Limitations

1. **Extreme Complexity:** 189K lines of Go; overwhelming terminology
2. **High Costs:** $100/hour token burn at peak reported
3. **Reliability Issues:** "Murderous Deacon," auto-merged failing tests
4. **Maturity Gate:** Only for Stage 7-8 developers
5. **Crypto Stigma:** BAGS controversy taints perception
6. **Unreviewed Code:** Security/quality concerns from 44K unreviewed lines
7. **Learning Curve:** Role-based metaphor requires significant adoption effort

## Who Should Use This

**Experimental Use Only For:**
- Stage 7-8 developers already running 5-10 agents comfortably
- Teams with significant parallelizable work
- Early adopters willing to accept instability
- Researchers studying multi-agent orchestration

**Wait/Avoid If:**
- Not yet comfortable with single-agent workflows
- Teams under 10 engineers (coordination overhead exceeds gains)
- Production environments requiring stability
- Risk-averse about unreviewed AI-generated code
- Concerned about crypto associations

## Competitive Landscape

| Tool | Approach | Gas Town Differentiation |
|------|----------|-------------------------|
| multiclaude | Git worktrees, tmux | Simpler; less orchestration |
| Ralph Wiggum | Spec-driven iteration loop | No parallel execution |
| oh-my-claudecode | Plugin with modes | Different philosophy |
| Claude Squad | Simpler parallel execution | Less elaborate hierarchy |
| Conductor Build | Emerging standard | Not yet available |

## Verdict

**Rating: Mixed (Experimental/Controversial)**

Gas Town represents the most ambitious attempt at multi-agent orchestration for AI coding, with genuine architectural innovations (external memory, role-based coordination, git-backed state). The vision of "Kubernetes for agents" may prove prescient.

However, the project is deeply controversial:
- BAGS/GAS token pump-and-dump damaged trust
- "44K lines no human looked at" raises quality/security concerns
- $100/hour costs and reliability issues ("murderous Deacon")
- Extreme complexity with fabricated terminology
- Explicitly gates out most developers (Stage 7-8 only)

**Recommendation:** Watch from a distance. The architectural patterns are worth studying, but Gas Town itself is firmly experimental. Most developers should master single-agent workflows first, then consider simpler alternatives like multiclaude or Ralph. If you're genuinely at Stage 7-8 and willing to accept instability and controversy, there's nothing else quite like it—but enter with eyes wide open.
