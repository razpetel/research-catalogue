# Stitch by Google

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**URL:** https://stitch.withgoogle.com/
**Sentiment:** Positive

## Summary

Google Stitch is a free AI-powered UI design tool from Google Labs that generates mobile and web interfaces from natural language prompts or uploaded wireframes/sketches. Launched at Google I/O 2025, it was originally Galileo AI before Google's acquisition. Now powered by Gemini 3, Stitch offers 350 free generations/month (Standard) or 50/month (Experimental), exports to Figma and clean HTML/CSS/Tailwind/JSX, and integrates with Google's AI coding ecosystem (Antigravity, Jules, AI Studio). Reddit calls it "the first UI generator that has felt usable for real iteration," though concerns persist about Google's product graveyard and generic outputs without detailed prompts.

## User Sentiment

### Reddit

**Positive:**
- "Google Stitch is genuinely good. It's the first UI generator that has felt usable for real iteration." (r/codex)
- "I found that its great to iterate fast and see what sticks" (r/UXDesign)
- "The new Google Stitch update is absolutely insane. You can now build real, clickable app prototypes with AI in minutes" (r/AISEOInsider)

**Concerns:**
- "Google will abandon this product in the next 5 years after Figma implements the same in workflow directly" (r/androiddev)
- Generic outputs without detailed prompts
- Figma export limitations with Gemini 3 Thinking mode

### LinkedIn

- Professional interest from designers and PMs
- Recognition as "vibe coding" enabler
- Some disappointment with limitations vs. potential

## Strengths

| Strength | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Free access | No credit card, just Google account |
| Fast iteration | Seconds to complete UI layouts |
| Multiple outputs | Figma, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JSX |
| Ecosystem integration | Antigravity, Jules, AI Studio |
| Eliminates blank canvas | Good for ideation/prototyping |
| Responsive by default | Mobile + web variants |

## Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Generic without prompts | Needs detailed descriptions for quality |
| No real-time collaboration | Unlike Figma |
| No animation/interaction | Static outputs (Prototypes experimental) |
| Can't apply brand guidelines | No design system import |
| Google graveyard risk | Labs experiment status |
| Inconsistent experimental mode | Quality varies |

## Competitive Comparison

| Tool | Best For | Pricing |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Google Stitch** | Free rapid prototyping | Free |
| **Figma** | Professional collaboration | $15-45/mo |
| **v0 by Vercel** | React/Next.js components | Credit-based |
| **UXPin** | Interactive prototypes | $39-113/mo |
| **Lovable** | Full-stack apps | $20-100/mo |

## Ideal Users

- Founders/startup teams building MVPs
- Frontend developers needing rapid UI scaffolding
- Non-designers creating basic interfaces
- Product teams validating concepts quickly
- Vibe coders in Google ecosystem

## Bottom Line

Google Stitch is the best free option for AI-powered UI design generation in 2026. The Gemini 3 upgrade significantly improved output quality, and integration with Antigravity/Jules creates a complete AI app development stack within Google's ecosystem. The 350 free generations/month is generous, and direct Figma export bridges the gap to professional refinement.

**Caveats:** Generic outputs require detailed prompts, no real-time collaboration, and Google's history of killing products creates legitimate concern. Use Stitch for rapid ideation and prototyping, but expect to refine in Figma for production. For React/Next.js specifically, v0 may produce more immediately usable code; for full-stack apps, consider Lovable or Bolt.
