# Cognee Research Report

## Overview

**Cognee** is an open-source knowledge engine (Apache 2.0) that transforms raw data into persistent, structured AI memory using knowledge graphs and vector search. Built by Berlin-based startup topoteretes UG, founded by Vasilije Markovic, Cognee provides a Python-native ECL (Extract, Cognify, Load) pipeline that goes beyond traditional RAG by constructing actual knowledge graphs with ontology support (RDF + OWL), enabling multi-hop reasoning across interconnected concepts rather than simple semantic similarity matching.

With 12,396 GitHub stars, 1,222 forks, and active daily development (v0.5.2 released Feb 4, 2026), Cognee occupies a distinct position in the AI memory landscape. While competitors like Mem0 (40K+ stars, $24M Series A) optimize for simplicity with a universal memory API, Cognee optimizes for depth -- offering modular pipelines, custom Pydantic graph models, temporal knowledge graphs, and integration with graph databases (Neo4j, Memgraph, Kuzu) and vector stores (Qdrant). Today (Feb 19, 2026), Cognee announced $7.5M in funding led by Pebblebed with 42CAP, validating their approach with 70+ companies already implementing the platform.

The core API is remarkably concise -- `add()`, `cognify()`, `memify()`, `search()` -- but the real power lies in the customizable pipeline beneath. Cognee supports 30+ data sources, multiple search types (GRAPH_COMPLETION, CHUNKS, SUMMARIES, RAG_COMPLETION), background processing for large datasets, and a "Dreamify" tool for automated hyperparameter optimization. Self-published benchmarks on HotPotQA multi-hop questions show 0.93 human-like correctness, though independent validation is still pending.

## Technical Analysis

### Repository Health
- **GitHub Stars**: 12,396
- **Forks**: 1,222
- **Open Issues**: 49

### Architecture

**ECL Pipeline (Extract, Cognify, Load):**

| Step | Function | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Extract | `cognee.add()` | Ingest data from 30+ sources (text, PDF, images, audio) |
| Cognify | `cognee.cognify()` | Build knowledge graph: classify, chunk, extract entities, create relationships |
| Load | `cognee.memify()` | Enrich graph with memory algorithms, rule associations |
| Query | `cognee.search()` | Hybrid graph + vector retrieval with multiple search modes |

**Search Types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| GRAPH_COMPLETION | Natural language Q&A via graph traversal + LLM |
| CHUNKS | Relevant text chunk retrieval |
| SUMMARIES | Document/concept summaries |
| RAG_COMPLETION | "Is-a" relationship-based generation |

**Backend Support:**

| Category | Options |
|----------|---------|
| Graph DBs | Neo4j, Memgraph, Kuzu |
| Vector DBs | Qdrant, others |
| LLM Providers | OpenAI (default), Ollama (local), multiple via config |
| Deployment | Local, cloud, air-gapped |

### Key Features

1. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Automatically extracts entities, relationships, and concepts from unstructured data
2. **Ontology Support**: RDF + OWL for grounding LLM-generated graphs against external system rules
3. **Custom Graph Models**: Define domain-specific Pydantic models for targeted extraction
4. **Temporal Cognify**: Time-aware knowledge graph construction
5. **Modular Pipelines**: Custom extraction and enrichment tasks via `Task` objects
6. **Dreamify**: Automated hyperparameter optimization for graph quality
7. **Graph Visualization**: Built-in HTML graph rendering
8. **MCP Server**: cognee-mcp for Claude Desktop and AI assistant integration
9. **CLI**: Full-featured `cognee-cli` with built-in local UI
10. **30+ Data Sources**: Text, PDF, images, audio transcriptions, web scraping

### API Example

```python
import cognee
import asyncio

async def main():
    await cognee.add("Cognee turns documents into AI memory.")
    await cognee.cognify()
    await cognee.memify()
    results = await cognee.search("What does Cognee do?")
    for result in results:
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Benchmark Results (Self-Published)

**HotPotQA Multi-hop Questions (24 questions, 45 runs/system on Modal Cloud):**

| Metric | Cognee Score | Optimization Gain |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Human-like Correctness | 0.93 | +25% |
| DeepEval Correctness | 0.85 | +49% |
| F1 Score | 0.84 | +314% |
| Exact Match | 0.69 | +1618% |

Claims to outperform Mem0, LightRAG, and Graphiti across all metrics, with chain-of-thought retriever providing particular advantage in multi-hop scenarios. All eval code is open-sourced on GitHub.

**Caveat**: These are self-published benchmarks. The team acknowledges "LLM as a judge metrics are not reliable measure" and is developing specialized evaluation datasets with DeepEval.

## User Sentiment

**Overall: Positive**

### Reddit
Strong presence across 13+ subreddits (r/Rag, r/MachineLearning, r/CLine, r/AIMemory, r/LocalLLaMA, r/n8n, r/ollama, r/LangChain, r/ClaudeAI, r/LLMDevs, r/mcp, r/dataengineering, r/singularity). The team is exceptionally engaged in community discussions. Common themes:
- **Praise**: Technical depth of KG approach, modular pipeline design, local-first support, open-source benchmarks
- **Criticism**: "More DIY" than alternatives, no TypeScript SDK, steeper learning curve
- Notable: r/LLMDevs user called Cognee "the LiteLLM for KGs/GRAGs"
- r/AIMemory user: "when I teach my assistant something once...it actually remembers and suggests it next time"

### Twitter/X
Minimal presence. No viral tweets or major influencer endorsements found. The team focuses on Reddit, LinkedIn, and blog content rather than Twitter. Brand name collides with similar-sounding AI projects. This is a notable gap compared to Mem0's active @mem0ai account.

### LinkedIn
Moderate presence with endorsements from established figures:
- Santiago Valdarrama (svpino, large ML educator audience) shared Cognee content
- David Myriel (Memgraph) endorsed Cognee publicly
- Active company page with regular technical posts
- Vasilije Markovic maintains visible founder profile

## Recommendations

**Use Cognee if you need:**
- Knowledge graph-based memory with relationship traversal (not just vector similarity)
- Ontology grounding for regulated or knowledge-intensive domains
- Custom data pipelines with domain-specific entity extraction
- Multi-hop reasoning across interconnected concepts
- Local/privacy-preserving deployment with Ollama

**Use Mem0 instead if you need:**
- Simplest possible API (3 lines)
- Cross-platform support (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- TypeScript/JavaScript SDK
- Hosted platform with enterprise support today
- Proven production-grade reliability

**For Claude Code users:** Cognee MCP server provides persistent knowledge-graph memory that's more structured than file-based approaches. Particularly valuable for codebase indexing and technical documentation that benefits from relationship-aware retrieval.
