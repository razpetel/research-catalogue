# Entire.io Research Report

## Overview

Entire is a new developer platform founded by Thomas Dohmke, who served as GitHub CEO from 2021 to August 2025 and scaled GitHub Copilot from launch to ubiquity. Announced February 10, 2026, with a $60 million seed round at a $300 million valuation -- the largest seed round ever raised for a developer tools company. Led by Felicis Ventures, with participation from Madrona, Basis Set, M12 (Microsoft's venture arm), 20VC, and Cherry Ventures. Angel investors include Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, and former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang.

The company's thesis is stark: as AI coding agents produce the majority of code, the entire software development lifecycle must be rebuilt. Dohmke states: "Just like when automotive companies replaced the traditional, craft-based production system with the moving assembly line, we must now reimagine the software development lifecycle for a world where machines are the primary producers of code." More provocatively: "The concept of understanding and reviewing code is a dying paradigm." Entire is building three components: (1) a Git-compatible database that unifies AI-produced code, (2) a universal semantic reasoning layer that processes code relationships across agents, and (3) an AI-native interface supporting review and deployment of hundreds of changes daily. Only component #1 has shipped.

The first product, **Checkpoints**, is an open-source CLI (Go, MIT license) that hooks into Git to automatically capture AI agent sessions -- full transcripts, prompts, token usage, and AI-vs-human line attribution -- on a separate orphan branch (`entire/checkpoints/v1`) without cluttering the main codebase. It currently supports Claude Code and Gemini CLI, with Copilot and OpenCode support in community PRs. The `entireio/cli` repo has 2,719 stars in 9 days with 421+ issues, showing both strong interest and real early-adopter bugs. The 15-person team (planning to double) is remote-first and shipping daily.

## Technical Analysis

### Architecture
Checkpoints is a Go-based CLI with a well-designed architecture:

- **Git hooks** (prepare-commit-msg, post-commit, pre-push) capture sessions transparently
- **Orphan branch storage** (`entire/checkpoints/v1`) keeps agent context out of the main codebase
- **JSONL session parsing** reads Claude Code's session files from `~/.claude/projects/`
- **Two strategies**: `manual-commit` (default, checkpoints on `git commit`) and `auto-commit` (after each agent response)
- **4-layer config system**: environment variables > local settings > project settings > global settings
- **Auto-summarization** via Claude CLI at commit time (opt-in)
- **Best-effort secrets redaction** when writing to the checkpoint branch
- **Git worktree support** with independent session tracking per worktree
- **Concurrent sessions** tracked separately with collision warnings

### Commands
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `entire enable` | Install hooks, configure strategy |
| `entire disable` | Remove hooks (data preserved) |
| `entire status` | Show sessions, strategy, checkpoint count |
| `entire rewind` | Restore to previous checkpoint |
| `entire resume <branch>` | Checkout branch, restore session metadata |
| `entire explain` | Show transcript, tokens, attribution for a checkpoint |
| `entire doctor` | Fix stuck sessions |
| `entire reset` | Delete shadow branch and session state |
| `entire clean` | Remove orphaned data |

### Installation
```bash
brew tap entireio/tap && brew install entireio/tap/entire
# Or: go install github.com/entireio/cli/cmd/entire@latest
cd your-project && entire enable
```

### Active Bugs (9 days old, expected for a new product)
- **Attribution calculation**: Always reports 0% agent contribution due to 3 interrelated bugs in the condensation pipeline (#421)
- **CJK encoding**: Byte-level truncation corrupts multi-byte characters in context.md (#419)
- **Session restart**: Hooks not executing after session transitions from ended to idle (#411)
- **Zombie sessions**: Stale sessions condensed into every commit indefinitely (#418, PR with fix)
- **Privacy concerns**: Community asking about data handling, AI training, SOC II compliance (#409)

### Team (from commit history)
- Victor Gutierrez Calderon (victor@entire.io) -- most active committer
- Alex Ong (alex@entire.io) -- contributor
- Robin Wohlers-Reichel (robin@entire.io) -- contributor
- Evis Drenova -- Principal Engineer (demo video)
- Thomas Dohmke -- CEO/founder

### Open-Source Ecosystem
- **open-entire** (yibudak): Community recreation in Go, alpha stage -- validates that the concept is simple enough to replicate independently
- Multiple developer test repos appeared within hours of launch

## User Sentiment

**Overall: Positive (with healthy skepticism about the valuation)**

- **Reddit**: Too early for meaningful user reviews. r/ClaudeCode and r/github threads exist but are primarily news-sharing. No "I tried it and..." posts yet. Community engagement is awareness-stage, not adoption-stage.
- **Twitter/X**: High buzz volume (341K+ views on launch tweet). Strong international interest, particularly from the Japanese tech community. Announcement-driven rather than organic user discussion. "Rebels" branding resonates with the developer community.
- **LinkedIn**: Standard VC-backed launch pattern. Investor amplification from Felicis and Madrona partners. Professional interest from DevOps and platform engineering communities. Limited deep technical discussion.

## Competitive Landscape

| Name | Difference |
|------|------------|
| **claude-trace** (badlogic) | Exposes Claude Code internals but doesn't persist context in Git. Diagnostics vs. workflow integration. |
| **Beads** (Steve Yegge) | Git-backed task tracking for agent persistence, but focuses on tasks not session transcripts. Complementary. |
| **open-entire** (yibudak) | Open-source recreation, validates concept replicability but lacks team/funding. |
| **Git itself** | Tracks what changed, not why. Entire fills the "why" gap for AI-generated code. |
| **GitHub Copilot telemetry** | Enterprise-only, closed, doesn't expose to developers. |

**Key differentiator**: No direct competitor has this combination of (a) ex-GitHub CEO credibility, (b) $60M funding, (c) MIT-licensed open-source, and (d) a clear thesis about the "review bottleneck" in AI-heavy codebases. The concept itself is straightforward enough that open-entire replicated it in days, but the company is betting on network effects and the semantic layer that comes next.

## Pricing
- **Checkpoints CLI**: Free, open-source (MIT)
- **Platform (future)**: Freemium expected (SiliconANGLE mentions hosted web UI + cloud features)
- **Business model**: Likely enterprise features around team dashboards, compliance, and the semantic layer

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Founder pedigree: built Copilot at GitHub | $300M valuation for a 9-day-old, single-product company |
| Solves real problem: AI context loss in Git | Only Checkpoints has shipped; semantic layer and interface are vaporware |
| MIT-licensed, open-source, no vendor lock-in | Real bugs in attribution, encoding, session management |
| Active development: daily merges, community PRs | Concept is simple enough for community to replicate (open-entire) |
| Agent-agnostic design (Claude, Gemini, Copilot coming) | Privacy questions unanswered (telemetry to Posthog, no SOC II) |
| Clean Git integration: orphan branch doesn't pollute history | Public repos expose all session transcripts on checkpoint branch |
| Strong investor syndicate (Felicis, M12, YC CEO) | No meaningful user reviews yet -- all coverage is announcement-driven |
| "Black box flight recorder" metaphor resonates | "The concept of understanding and reviewing code is a dying paradigm" -- controversial claim |

## Key Takeaway

Entire is the highest-conviction bet in the "AI-generated code management" category, backed by the person who arguably knows the developer tools market better than anyone alive. The Checkpoints CLI is a solid v0.4 product that solves a real pain point (losing AI context when agents generate code), but it's 9 days old with active bugs and zero user reviews. The $300M valuation prices in a future platform that doesn't exist yet. The open-source approach is genuine and the development velocity is high. Worth installing today if you use Claude Code or Gemini CLI; the question is whether the full platform materializes before the concept becomes a commodity feature in competing tools.
