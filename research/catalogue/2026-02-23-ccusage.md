## Key Insights

- **The Claude Code usage tracking standard** with 10.9K stars -- the first and most widely adopted tool for understanding token consumption and cost, spawning 20+ derivative projects across every platform (macOS menu bar, tmux, Neovim, VS Code, Raycast, zsh, Waybar, Slack)
- **Endorsed by the Claude Code ecosystem**: the @claude_code community account officially recommends "Use `ccusage` to track usage" and it's featured on ClaudeLog, Awesome Claude Code, and Context7 (High reputation)
- **Cultural phenomenon**: ccusage screenshots became social currency in the Claude Code community -- "look how much I'm burning" -- similar to Spotify Wrapped for AI token consumption. Greg Baugues featured it in a viral YouTube interview: "The Claude Code cost scorecard that went viral"
- **Revealed hidden limits**: ccusage was how the community first discovered actual token allocations (e.g., "50M tokens per 5h on a 20x Max plan"), making opaque subscription quotas visible
- **Known limitation**: cost estimates are approximations (token counts are accurate, pulled from Claude Code logs, but dollar amounts use LiteLLM pricing which may not match actual billing). No real-time monitoring in the core CLI -- complementary tools needed for live dashboards
- **Massive ecosystem expansion**: the "ccusage family" now covers Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, Pi-agent, and Amp with separate packages, plus a built-in MCP server

## What It Does

ccusage reads Claude Code's local JSONL session files (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/<conversation>.jsonl`) and generates detailed usage reports. No API keys, no cloud services, no installation required -- runs via `npx ccusage@latest`.

### Report Types
- **Daily**: Token usage and costs by date (default command)
- **Monthly**: Aggregated monthly patterns
- **Session**: Per-conversation breakdown
- **Blocks**: 5-hour billing windows aligned with Claude's usage cycles
- **Statusline**: Compact real-time display for Claude Code's status bar (Beta)
- **Live Monitoring**: `blocks --live` for real-time burn rate and projections

### Key Capabilities
- Per-model cost breakdown (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) with `--breakdown`
- Cache token tracking (creation vs. read separately)
- Date range filtering with `--since` / `--until`
- JSON export for programmatic integration
- Multi-instance/project grouping with `--instances`
- Timezone and locale customization
- Offline mode with pre-cached pricing data
- Configuration files with IDE autocomplete support
- Ultra-small bundle size (emphasized as a project value)

### Installation
```bash
npx ccusage@latest          # Recommended (always latest)
bunx ccusage                # Bun (faster)
pnpm dlx ccusage            # pnpm alternative
```

### Related Tools
```bash
npx @ccusage/codex@latest       # OpenAI Codex
npx @ccusage/opencode@latest    # OpenCode
npx @ccusage/pi@latest          # Pi-agent
npx @ccusage/amp@latest         # Amp
npx @ccusage/mcp@latest         # MCP Server
```

## Competitive Landscape

| Tool | Approach | Stars | Best For |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **ccusage** | CLI + historical reports | 10.9K | Quick cost checks, trending |
| **splitrail** | Cross-platform real-time | N/A | Multi-tool monitoring (Gemini, Codex, etc.) |
| **Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor** | Python real-time dashboard | ~700 | Live predictions |
| **claude-code-otel** | OpenTelemetry + Grafana | N/A | Enterprise/team observability |
| **better-ccusage** | ccusage fork, multi-provider | N/A | External provider support |
| **AgentLimits** | macOS native widgets | N/A | Desktop-native heatmaps |
| **claude-devtools** | Session log reconstructor | N/A | Full session replay |
| **Built-in `/cost`** | Anthropic official | N/A | API users, current session only |
| **Built-in `/stats`** | Anthropic official | N/A | Max/Pro subscribers |

ccusage dominates the category by an order of magnitude in adoption. Its main gap -- lack of real-time monitoring -- is partially addressed by the `blocks --live` and statusline features, plus companion tools like Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor and AgentLimits.

## Technical Details

- **Runtime**: Bun (recommended) or Node.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Data Source**: `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL files (local, privacy-preserving)
- **Pricing Data**: Fetched from GitHub raw content, cached locally; offline fallback
- **Config**: JSON files with schema validation + CLI flags + env vars
- **MCP**: Built-in Model Context Protocol server (`@ccusage/mcp`)
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Development**: Nix flake for reproducible dev environment

### Known Limitations
1. **Cost estimates are approximations**: Token counts are accurate (from Claude Code logs), but dollar costs use external pricing data that may not match actual Anthropic billing
2. **Output token count inaccuracy**: Issue #705 reports output token counts being "highly inaccurate"
3. **Statusline CPU bug**: Issue #459 -- infinite process spawning loop causing 100% CPU usage (17 comments, still open)
4. **Performance with large data**: Issue #821 -- timeout with ~750 files / 4GB data directories
5. **Sub-task tracking gap**: Issue #313 (20 comments) -- tracking token usage in Claude Code sub-agents/sub-tasks not fully supported
6. **Single maintainer**: ryoppippi has 794 of ~830 non-bot commits (>95%)

## Community Reception

### Reddit (Primary Community Hub)
- ccusage is the standard recommendation in "how do I track Claude Code usage?" threads
- Author's launch post framed as "see how much you're saving with Max plan" -- highly effective hook
- "50M tokens per 5h" discovery post (52 upvotes) was a watershed moment for community understanding of quotas
- Statusline integration announcement well-received
- Community acknowledges cost estimates are approximations but values the insight

### Hacker News
- Thread focused more on Claude Code economics than the tool itself
- Users praised zero-install ergonomics ("I really like how easy it is to run using bunx")

## Development Status

**Active but maintenance-focused**: 30 releases reaching v18.0.5. Recent commits (Feb 2026) are primarily dependency updates and CI maintenance rather than feature additions. The core functionality appears stable, with major open issues (#459 CPU bug, #705 token accuracy, #313 sub-task tracking) remaining unresolved.

The author's bio -- "coder without AI" -- is a notable counterpoint to the tool's purpose.

## Recommendations

**Use ccusage if:**
- You want quick, zero-install insight into Claude Code token usage and costs
- You need historical analysis (daily/monthly/session trends)
- You want JSON output for scripting or dashboards
- You use Claude Code on Max/Pro and want to understand your "virtual cost"

**Complement with:**
- Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor for real-time predictions
- AgentLimits for macOS native widgets
- `/cost` and `/stats` for official in-session data
- Console analytics for team-level tracking

**Watch out for:**
- Cost estimates are approximations, not actual billing data
- Statusline feature has an open CPU-hogging bug
- Performance degrades with very large data directories
- Single maintainer (bus factor of 1)

**Bottom line**: The undisputed standard for Claude Code usage tracking with 10.9K stars, ~95K monthly npm downloads, and 20+ ecosystem integrations. It revealed hidden token limits, created a cultural phenomenon around usage sharing, and established an entire tool category. Core functionality is mature and stable; the main gaps are real-time monitoring and output token accuracy. Essential for any Claude Code power user.
