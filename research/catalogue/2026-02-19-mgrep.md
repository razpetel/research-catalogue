# mgrep Research Report

## Overview

mgrep is a CLI-native semantic search tool by Mixedbread, a Munich-based AI startup specializing in embedding and reranking models. It positions itself as the natural language successor to grep, enabling developers and AI coding agents to search codebases, PDFs, images, and text files using intent-based queries rather than exact pattern matching. With 3,285 GitHub stars since its November 2025 launch, mgrep has rapidly become one of the most discussed tools in the Claude Code ecosystem.

The tool's core value proposition is straightforward: AI coding agents waste enormous token budgets scanning irrelevant code through brute-force grep. mgrep's cloud-backed semantic search finds relevant snippets in fewer queries, letting the model spend capacity on reasoning instead of scanning. In Mixedbread's 50-task benchmark, mgrep halved token consumption while achieving a 76% quality win rate over grep workflows. Independent sources (Kasava) cite 53% cost reduction ($0.23 vs $0.49 per task). Multiple Reddit users report "insane results" and list it among essential Claude Code tools.

However, mgrep's defining tradeoff is cloud dependency. Every indexed file is synced to Mixedbread's servers, which enables shared team indexes and powerful inference but creates an unavoidable privacy concern. This has already spawned at least three local-only alternatives (GrepAI, ygrep, Pommel), with developers explicitly citing mgrep's cloud requirement as motivation. Windows support remains broken across multiple open issues, and the tool is still pre-1.0 (v0.1.10) with a small contributor base (primarily one developer, Joel Dierkes, with 127 of ~170 commits).

## Technical Analysis

### Architecture
mgrep is a TypeScript CLI tool distributed via npm (`@mixedbread/mgrep`). Under the hood, it uses Mixedbread Search, the company's full-featured search API combining state-of-the-art semantic retrieval models with context-aware parsing and optimized inference. Files are pushed into a Mixedbread Store using the same SDK available to developers building search applications.

### Key Features
- **Semantic search**: Natural language queries across code, text, PDFs, and images (audio/video planned)
- **Background indexing**: `mgrep watch` respects `.gitignore` and `.mgrepignore`, keeping the cloud store in sync via file watchers
- **Web search**: `--web` flag queries the web alongside local files
- **Agentic mode**: `--agentic` breaks complex queries into sub-queries automatically
- **Answer generation**: `--answer` flag produces LLM-generated summaries from results
- **Agent integrations**: One-command install for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and Factory Droid
- **Reranking**: Enabled by default using Mixedbread's reranking models (disable with `--no-rerank`)
- **Configuration**: YAML config files, environment variables, and CLI flags with clear precedence hierarchy
- **Default limits**: 1MB per file, 1,000 files per directory (configurable)

### Benchmarks
From Mixedbread's 50-task QA evaluation with Claude Code:
- **Cost**: $0.23/query (mgrep) vs $0.49/query (grep) -- 53% reduction
- **Speed**: 82ms (mgrep) vs 158ms (grep) -- 48% improvement
- **Quality**: 76% win rate in LLM-judged preference evaluations
- **Token usage**: ~2x fewer input tokens

Note: Win rate was calculated using an LLM as judge, and the benchmark was produced by Mixedbread themselves. No independent third-party benchmarks exist yet.

### Repository Health
- **Stars**: 3,285 | **Forks**: 125 | **Open issues**: 42
- **Releases**: 5 (v0.1.6 through v0.1.10), roughly monthly cadence
- **Contributors**: Primarily Joel Dierkes (127 commits), with nainglinnkhant (30 commits) and 3 minor contributors
- **Tests**: bats (bash automated testing), no comprehensive test suite noted
- **License**: Apache-2.0

### Known Issues
- **Windows**: Broken -- `os.setsid` not available on Windows, hook scripts use POSIX-only paths (3+ open issues)
- **Claude Code plugin**: Background sync issues, SessionEnd problems
- **Quota confusion**: Users report quota exceeded in CLI while web platform shows available tokens
- **Accidental indexing**: `mgrep watch` has indexed entire home directories in some cases
- **Store deletion**: Re-indexing fails after deleting a store

## User Sentiment

**Overall: Positive (with significant privacy caveats)**

- **Reddit**: Enthusiastic adoption in r/ClaudeCode and r/AugmentCodeAI. Users call it "insane results" and list it among essential Claude Code tools. The cloud sync requirement is the primary objection, directly inspiring GrepAI and ygrep as local alternatives. Multiple threads debating whether Anthropic should integrate mgrep natively.

- **Twitter/X**: Medium buzz with rising trend. Joel Dierkes (author) actively promoting integrations. NLP researchers (Ben Clavie) using it for personal multimodal search. Chinese tech community picking up. French developer (Yoan Bernabeu) created GrepAI specifically because of mgrep's cloud requirement, calling it "top, but sending my codebase to yet another paid cloud? Never."

- **LinkedIn**: Professional adoption signals from multiple developers posting about 2x performance improvements. Jerry Liu (LlamaIndex co-founder) validating the semantic grep category. Limited volume but quality endorsements from recognized practitioners.

## Competitive Landscape

The semantic code search space is rapidly crowding as developers recognize that AI agents waste tokens on brute-force grep:

| Tool | Approach | Cloud/Local | Maturity | Stars |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **mgrep** | Embedding-based semantic search | Cloud-only | Pre-1.0 (v0.1.10) | 3,285 |
| **GrepAI** | Ollama/local embeddings + call graph | Local-only | Experimental | ~500 |
| **ygrep** | Index-based + semantic + regex | Local-only | Early | New |
| **Serena** | Symbol-level semantic retrieval MCP | Local | Active | ~2K |
| **Pommel** | Local semantic code search | Local | Early | New |
| **WarpGrep** | Cognition's SWE-Grep via MCP | Local | Early | ~600 |
| **ast-grep** | AST structural matching | Local | Mature | ~8K |
| **Augment Code** | Enterprise context engine | Cloud | Production | N/A |

mgrep's advantage is the quality of Mixedbread's underlying search infrastructure (proven embedding models, reranking, multimodal support) and the simplest agent integration story. Its disadvantage is the non-negotiable cloud sync requirement.

## Company Context: Mixedbread

- **Founded**: December 2023 (Munich, Germany)
- **Focus**: AI search infrastructure -- embedding and reranking models
- **Funding**: Pre-seed (undisclosed amount, 4 investors including Tiny Supercomputer Investment Company)
- **Open-source footprint**: 39 repos, 208 GitHub followers, popular HuggingFace models (mxbai-embed-large-v1, mxbai-rerank-v2)
- **Integrations**: LlamaIndex, Haystack, Vercel Marketplace
- **mgrep is a product play**: drives adoption of the Mixedbread Search platform through developer tooling

## Pricing

| Plan | Monthly | Key Limits |
|------|---------|------------|
| Basic (Free) | $0 | 3 stores, 3 users, included quotas |
| Scale | $20/mo + usage | 1,000 stores, unlimited users |
| Enterprise | Custom | BYOC, custom SLA |

**Usage-based pricing (Scale plan)**:
- Ingestion: $1.50-3/1M tokens
- Storage: $0.50/1M tokens/month
- Search: $4/1K queries (or $7.50/1K with rerank)
- Parsing: $0.02/page

Practical cost: ~$20/month for an active individual developer. The free tier is useful for evaluation but quotas are tight for daily use.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Genuine token savings (2x fewer) in AI coding workflows | Mandatory cloud sync -- all files sent to Mixedbread servers |
| One-command agent integration (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Droid) | No local/offline mode available |
| Multimodal: code, text, PDFs, images | Windows completely broken (3+ unresolved issues) |
| Natural language queries reduce cognitive load | Pre-1.0 with small contributor base (primarily 1 developer) |
| Backed by real AI search company with proven embedding models | Vendor lock-in to Mixedbread platform |
| Web search + agentic mode for complex queries | LLM-judged benchmarks are self-produced |
| Free tier available for evaluation | Accidental broad indexing possible (home directory bug) |
| Shared team indexes without re-uploading | No MCP server (Codex uses MCP via separate integration) |
| Apache-2.0 licensed | Growing local-only alternatives may erode advantage |
