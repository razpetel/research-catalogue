# Primer: AI Repo Preparation Tool

> CLI tool by VS Code Product Lead Pierce Boggan that automatically generates repository instructions for AI-assisted development, with an evaluation framework to measure instruction quality.

**Research Date:** 2026-02-02
**Category:** AI Development Tools / Context Engineering
**Sentiment:** Positive (promising, early stage)

---

## Key Insights

1. **Insider origin with enterprise ambition** — Primer comes from the VS Code Product Lead himself, suggesting it reflects internal Microsoft thinking on how repos should be prepared for AI. The batch processing + automated PR feature targets organizational adoption, not just individual developers.

2. **Addresses the evaluation gap** — Unlike manual approaches (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md), Primer includes an evaluation framework that measures whether generated instructions actually improve AI responses. This is a differentiator no other tool offers.

3. **Very early, Mac-only** — 4 days old with 470 stars but 50% of open issues are Windows compatibility problems. The tool is not production-ready for Windows teams.

4. **Complements rather than replaces existing context engineering** — Primer generates `copilot-instructions.md` files, which is just one piece of the context engineering stack. For Claude Code users, the output could be adapted to CLAUDE.md format.

5. **Copilot SDK dependency** — Requires GitHub Copilot CLI authentication, which locks it to the Copilot ecosystem. Not directly usable for Claude-only workflows without modification.

## What It Does

Primer is a CLI tool that:

1. **Analyzes repositories** — Detects languages, frameworks, package managers
2. **Generates instructions** — Creates `.github/copilot-instructions.md` files using Copilot SDK's agentic code search
3. **Evaluates quality** — Runs test prompts with/without instructions, uses judge model to score improvements
4. **Scales to organizations** — Batch processes multiple repos, auto-creates PRs

### Commands

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts init          # Interactive setup
npx tsx src/index.ts instructions  # Generate copilot instructions
npx tsx src/index.ts eval          # Run evaluation framework
npx tsx src/index.ts batch         # Process multiple repos
npx tsx src/index.ts pr            # Create pull requests
npx tsx src/index.ts generate mcp  # Generate MCP config
npx tsx src/index.ts generate agents   # Generate agent configs
```

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- GitHub Copilot CLI (from VS Code Copilot Chat extension)
- Copilot CLI authentication
- GitHub CLI (for batch operations)
- **macOS only** (Windows support pending)

---

## Creator Context

**Pierce Boggan** leads VS Code as it evolves into an AI-native editor:

- Joined Microsoft via Xamarin acquisition
- Responsible for MCP server integration in VS Code
- Philosophy: "AI 1.0 = speeding up processes; AI 2.0 = totally new ways of working"
- Emphasis on developer empathy over pure metrics

Quote from interview:
> "All of us are developers...if anything in the product feels off, like we get personally pissed off."

Primer represents his vision for how repos should be prepared for AI agents.

## Ecosystem Comparison

| Tool | Approach | Format | Evaluation |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Primer** | Auto-generate instructions | copilot-instructions.md | Yes |
| **AGENTS.md** | Manual hierarchical | AGENTS.md | No |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Manual project context | CLAUDE.md | No |
| **Repomix** | Pack repo into single file | XML/Markdown | No |
| **rulebook-ai** | Composable "packs" | copilot-instructions.md | No |
| **Context7** | Real-time doc retrieval | MCP server | No |

### Format Wars

The AI instruction format landscape is fragmented:

- **copilot-instructions.md** — GitHub Copilot's format, always attached to prompts
- **AGENTS.md** — Open standard used by Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor; hierarchical (88 files in OpenAI repo)
- **CLAUDE.md** — Anthropic's format for Claude Code
- **.cursorrules** — Cursor's format

Community consensus: "Each AI writes better instructions files for themselves." Primer currently outputs only copilot-instructions.md.

---

## Evaluation Framework

The unique value proposition:

1. Runs test prompts against repo **without** generated instructions
2. Runs same prompts **with** generated instructions
3. Judge model scores both responses
4. Generates comparison report

This addresses a key gap — most instruction approaches are "trust me, it helps" without measurement.

---

## Current Limitations

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Windows support | 3 open issues, not functional |
| Copilot dependency | Requires Copilot CLI auth |
| Single format output | Only copilot-instructions.md |
| Very new | 4 days old, single developer |
| No AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md | Would need manual conversion |

## LinkedIn Endorsement

Oren Melamed (AI professional at Gloat) shared Pierce's post:

> "A must have tool for pushing your team's or company's adoption but responsibly and effectively."

Plans to expand across organization with metrics collection and evaluation scoring.

## Relation to Prior Research

### Context Engineering (2026-02-02)

Primer automates one piece of the context engineering stack documented in prior research. The key insight from that report:

> "Find the smallest set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of your desired outcome."

Primer attempts to generate these high-signal tokens automatically rather than requiring manual curation.

### AGENTS.md vs Skills (2026-02-02)

Vercel's evaluation showed AGENTS.md (passive context) achieved 100% pass rate vs Skills' 53% for Next.js 16 APIs. Primer's approach aligns with passive context injection, though in a different format.

## Recommendations

**Use Primer if:**
- You're on macOS
- Your team uses GitHub Copilot
- You want to measure instruction effectiveness
- You need to roll out AI-readiness across many repos

**Skip Primer if:**
- You're on Windows (wait for support)
- You use Claude Code exclusively (would need format conversion)
- You need AGENTS.md format
- You want a production-tested tool (too early)

**For Claude Code users:**
- Run Primer to generate instructions
- Manually adapt output to CLAUDE.md format
- Or wait for community forks that support multiple formats

---

## Summary

Primer is an interesting early-stage tool from an insider source. Its evaluation framework is a genuine innovation in the repo preparation space. However, at 4 days old with Windows issues and Copilot lock-in, it's not ready for broad adoption. Watch this space — if it matures and adds format flexibility, it could become the standard for enterprise AI-readiness.

**Bottom line:** Promising direction from authoritative source; early adopters only; watch for Windows support and multi-format output.
